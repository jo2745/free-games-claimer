## What's new in 2.12.5.3

**New watcher: IKEA Family Rewards — a logged-in points collector that pings you the moment a new activity is posted.**

IKEA's Family program runs the opposite way from every other service here: games come to you, but *points* come from showing up. They're earned through quizzes, check-ins, and seasonal card games, and posted on the member-only rewards page on a rolling basis — if you're not looking at that page when a new one lands, the activity can close (or the balance window can) before you ever see it. This watcher closes that gap: on every run it visits the rewards page in its **own isolated browser profile** (log in once via the Sessions row — 2FA by hand in noVNC if your country requires it) and scans the client-rendered page (main frame + iframes) for posted earn-activities and your points balance, then **notifies (Pushover + Alerts tab) when a new activity appears or your balance moves** — with a deep link into the noVNC login flow, because completing the activity is *your* click: IKEA's activity/anti-bot UI is exactly the kind of flow where auto-clicking is how a Family account gets flagged, so it's notify-then-act like the other fragile-UI watchers.

- **Multilingual activity vocabulary** — the in-page scan matches earn-CTA wording across FI/SE/Nordic/EN (quizzes, check-ins, lotteries, campaigns, …) and deliberately excludes the *redemption* vocabulary — redeeming *spends* the points you're collecting, so those tiles are never flagged. The patterns are a single source of truth passed into the in-page scan as arguments, so the two copies can't drift apart.
- **First run = baseline only** (no notifications); every run after that notifies on the diff: a newly posted activity, or balance movement (points landed after you finished an activity). A corrupted state file re-baselines instead of faking a dozen "new" activities.
- **Country-agnostic** — each country's rewards page lives at a different path, so the page URL is a service setting (Settings → Services → IKEA Family Rewards → *Rewards page URL*, or the `IKEA_REWARDS_URL` env var in compose-only deploys). Default is Finland's page, the program this watcher was built for.
- Opt-in (`IKEA_ACTIVE=1` or the Settings toggle) and it runs last in the chain, after every other service — light visits, and IKEA's anti-bot never shares a cookie jar with your store logins.

## What's new in 2.12.5.2

**Custom websites: one isolated browser profile per website — a captcha on one site can't poison the others.**

v2.12.5.1 visited all custom URLs in the *shared* browser profile — the same cookie jar Epic, Steam, and Prime already live in. That's wrong as soon as any one custom site gets a captcha, a bot-wall, or a stale login: the block/stale state sits in the shared profile and starts breaking the unrelated stores (and vice versa). This release gives **every configured website its own `data/browser-custom-<host>` profile** and its own Sessions-tab row:

- **Isolation.** A captcha-walled, blocked, or unreachable site now fails *only itself* — the runner visits each remaining site in its own profile, and the post-run summary reports per-site ✓/✗. Your Epic/Steam/Prime sessions (shared profile) and the other custom sites (their own profiles) are untouched.
- **Per-site tracking.** Every website you add becomes its own Sessions-tab card with its own Login button, its own session check, and its own stale-session alert line — the panel flags *exactly which site* went stale, and the post-run Pushover deep-link opens that site's login flow. Each site's sign-in probe is pinned to its own URL (the generic visible-sign-in-control heuristic, verified on the site's own page in its own profile).
- **Runtime additions still work.** As before, URLs added via Settings after boot are picked up live (the per-site entries re-derive from `data/config.json` on every poll/run) — no container restart needed, and each new site gets its own profile + row automatically.
- **Per-site Runs.** The Run button on one site's card visits only that site (`CUSTOM_SITE_ID` scoping); Run All / the claim chain visits all of them.

If you adopted 2.12.5.1 and logged custom sites in via the shared profile: re-login is required once per site (the per-site profiles start empty) — log in to each via its new Sessions row, and from then on the sessions are properly isolated.

Files: `src/platforms/custom-website.js` (per-site loop + `CUSTOM_SITE_ID` scoping), `src/sites.js` (per-site entry derivation, generic per-site sign-in probe, parent entry demoted to a settings/runner carrier), `src/panel/panel.js` (live per-site merge into Sessions rows, session checks, run/launch/verify/close, run-all/run-service scoping, startup auto-check), `src/config.js` (`cw_active` for the runner gate), `README.md` / `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`.

## What's new in 2.12.5.1

**Feature: custom websites — visit any URLs you name, in the shared browser, on every run.**

A growing number of storefronts and apps (Temu, Lenovo, …) award points or coins for simply being logged in and visiting a page each day — no game to claim, no flow to script. This release adds a generic **Custom websites** service so you can cover that class of site without waiting for a per-site script:

- **Add any URL** in Settings → Services → Custom websites (one per line, in a textarea — also settable via the `CUSTOM_URLS` env var for compose-only deploys). The URLs are visited in the shared browser profile on every run of the main claim chain (runs last, after all claimers and Microsoft Rewards), so the sites' "daily login" beacons fire while you're logged in.
- **Log in once, ride the shared profile.** Each custom site gets a real Sessions-tab entry: click its Login button to land in a noVNC browser on the first configured URL, do the login (incl. 2FA/captcha) by hand, and the session persists in the shared profile for every future run.
- **Generic sign-in probe.** Arbitrary sites can't have a hand-written login check, so the panel verifies sessions with a structural heuristic (a visible sign-in control ⇒ stale) — the same pattern the project already relies on for unknown third-party UIs (FAB, AliExpress). A stale custom-site session surfaces in the Alerts tab and in the post-run Pushover deep-links exactly like any other service, so you get pinged the moment a login expires.
- **Opt-in, zero blast radius.** The service is off by default (`CW_ACTIVE`) and has no runner/URLs to speak of until you configure one — existing deploys' behavior is byte-identical. When no URLs are configured the runner no-ops cleanly instead of failing the run.

Files: `src/platforms/custom-website.js` (new runner), `src/sites.js` (registry entry + live `data/config.json` read so URLs added after boot are visible to the Sessions flow without a restart), `src/config.js` (`custom_urls`), `src/util.js` (`visited` summary metric), `README.md` / `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` (env + feature docs).

## What's new in 2.12.5

**Fix: Tier-2 auto-dismiss now actually clears one-off script errors.**

Since v2.8.78 shipped the "transient-likely" diagnostic filter, the recorder has looked up the wrong key when deciding whether an error's service had prior success:

- Scanner picks `script` from the log-header regex (`─── Epic Games (v2.2) ──`) → display name `"Epic Games"`.
- `_recordDiagnosticError` then read `lastRunSuccess["epic games"]` (lowercased display name).
- But `lastRunSuccess` and every `sites.js` registry entry are keyed by the kebab-case id `"epic-games"`.

Result: every fresh single-occurrence error recorded since v2.8.78 got `transientLikely: false`, the banner-suppression + auto-dismiss on next-success path never fired, and every count-1 script blip has sat in the Diagnostics/Alerts list until the user manually shared or dismissed it. In @feldorn's DB an Epic Games `page.goto: Timeout 60000ms exceeded` from 2026-08-28 was still showing 30 days later despite ~30 clean Epic runs in the meantime.

**Fix:**

1. **Resolver.** New `_resolveSiteIdFromScript()` walks `SITE_REGISTRY` (< 20 rows) and returns the site id for a display-name or id string. Called from both the recorder and the sweep.
2. **Recorder.** `_recordDiagnosticError` now stores the resolved `siteId` on new entries and backfills it on existing ones, so future lookups don't depend on the display-name string round-trip.
3. **Sweep.** `_sweepTransientDiagnostics` matches by `entry.siteId` (with the resolver as a legacy fallback), so it actually finds the entries recorded for the site that just succeeded.
4. **One-time boot cleanup.** New `_sweepStaleUndecidedDiagnostics()` runs after diagnostics load: any undecided count-1 entry whose resolved site has a `lastRunSuccess` timestamp AFTER `firstSeen` is swept and logged. This purges the historical accumulation from the pre-fix window without waiting for the next occurrence of each dead fingerprint. Idempotent — safe to keep running on every boot.

Only sweeps count-1 undecided entries where a later success is on record for the same site; anything the user has acted on (Share / Dismiss / etc.) and anything with count ≥ 2 (real recurring signal) stays put.

## What's new in 2.12.4

**Fix: `PG_RETRY_PENDING` retries now heal codes MS rejects at client-side validation.**

v2.12.3 shipped the `PG_RETRY_PENDING` self-heal loop for stuck MS Store codes. First live run against @feldorn's DOOM Eternal (already redeemed manually during the v2.12.3 investigator) reported `1 retried, 0 healed, 1 still pending` — helper returned `redeem (validation failed)` because Next never enabled (MS's client-side validation refused the already-consumed code), but that outcome had no `dbStatus` update, so the entry stayed at `claimed` and the daily nag continued. Regressed from the intended "retry-heals-terminal" behavior.

**Fix:**

1. **Body-text scan on validation-fail.** When Next doesn't enable within 10s, `attemptMsStoreRedeem` now reads the iframe body and pattern-matches for terminal indicators:
   - "already own" / "already redeem" / "used by" / "is already" → `claimed and redeemed` (terminal)
   - "expired" / "no longer valid" → `claimed:token-invalid` (terminal)
   - "invalid" / "not recognized" / "check…code" → `claimed:token-invalid` (terminal)
2. **Retry-path default.** When no hint text is present AND the helper was called from the `PG_RETRY_PENDING` loop (`isRetry: true`), assume the code was consumed since capture and mark `claimed and redeemed`. Reasoning: retry-pool codes were valid when Prime captured them; a later "no" from MS overwhelmingly means the code got consumed in the meantime (self, MS's own re-attempt, or user manual redemption). Fresh-code first-attempt path stays conservative (no dbStatus change) — a true invalid-code case there deserves the extra caution.

**Result:** on the next Prime run with `PG_RETRY_PENDING=1`, @feldorn's DOOM Eternal flips to `claimed and redeemed` (terminal), drops out of the pending-notify list, disappears from the Alerts tab's Pending Redemptions section. Daily nag stops.

Preserves the safer fresh-code behavior — a hypothetical first-time capture of a truly invalid code still surfaces as manual-verify, not silently marked terminal.

## What's new in 2.12.3

**Feature: MS Store / Xbox Prime-code auto-redemption rewritten against the current UI + new `PG_RETRY_PENDING=1` self-heal flag.**

Long-standing pattern where fgc captured a Prime-provided MS Store code (e.g. DOOM Eternal) but then couldn't complete the external redemption is fixed. Root cause: Microsoft moved the redemption UI from a network-API-driven flow (`store-web.dynamics.com/v1.0/Redeem/PrepareRedeem` + `RedeemToken`) to a fully client-side React app served from `www.microsoft.com/store/purchase/buynowui/`. The old `waitForResponse` for those endpoints timed out at 60s because MS no longer fires network calls at those hosts — the whole state machine runs in-iframe, with the iframe's URL slug as the signal.

**Investigation (2026-09-27):** drove the full flow with @feldorn's DOOM Eternal code via a scratch investigator (`data/mstore-investigate.mjs`), capturing every network request + iframe URL transition + button state. Full network + UI capture archived in the report. Redemption succeeded live, confirming the observed flow works end-to-end.

**Current MS Store flow (as of 2026-09-27):**

| iframe URL slug | UI state |
|---|---|
| `.../buynowui/redeemnow` | `[name=tokenString]` input + disabled `Next` button |
| `.../buynowui/redeem-confirm` | product info + `Cancel` / `Confirm` buttons |
| `.../buynowui/redeem-success` | "You're good to go" + "X is ready for you" |
| `.../buynowui/redeem-{err,fail,invalid,expired}` | error state (defensive — patterns matched, exact slug label unobserved) |

**New helper:** `attemptMsStoreRedeem(page2, code)` in `src/platforms/prime-gaming.js` waits for iframe URL transitions instead of network responses. Fills code → waits for Next enabled → clicks → waits for iframe to leave `redeemnow` → dispatches by terminal slug:
- `redeem-success` on Next → already-redeemed shortcut (rare)
- `redeem-confirm` → click Confirm → wait for `redeem-success` → done
- `redeem-err/fail/invalid/expired` → parse error text, mark DB `claimed:token-invalid` (terminal — stops re-nagging)
- Anything else → unconfirmed state, DB stays `claimed`, still surfaces in Alerts

**New flag: `PG_RETRY_PENDING=1`.** Self-heal path for entries already stuck in `data/prime-gaming.json` with status `claimed` (external redemption never completed). On each Prime run, retries the external redemption via `attemptMsStoreRedeem`. Successful retries flip to `claimed and redeemed` (terminal). Codes MS says are invalid flip to `claimed:token-invalid` (terminal). Anything ambiguous stays `claimed` and shows in the daily reminder.

Default off — existing deploys keep the "capture code, tell user to redeem manually" behavior unless they opt in via env or `panel.pg.retryPending: true` in config.

**Migration for existing stuck codes:** users on `PG_RETRY_PENDING=1` who already redeemed their pending code manually (typed it at `account.microsoft.com/billing/redeem` in a browser) will see MS report "already redeemed" on the next Prime run; fgc auto-flips the DB status and the daily nag stops without any user action.

**Not changed:** GOG's `redeem.gog.com` API is stable and still uses the network-response flow. Xbox uses the same `www.microsoft.com/store/purchase/buynowui/` UI as MS Store, so the new helper covers both.

## What's new in 2.12.2

**Fix: Prime pending-redeem entries with status `'claimed'` now surface in the Alerts tab ([#155](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/155) @jcubby86).**

Reported live 2026-09-25: DOOM Eternal MS-Store redeem code was firing daily Pushover notifications for 5+ days with no way to dismiss. jcubby86 opened the Alerts tab expecting to find Mark redeemed / Dismiss buttons (they exist and work) — but the entire "Pending Redemptions" section was empty. Their `#alertsRedeems` div rendered, just with no rows.

**Root cause:** two-regex drift. `src/panel/panel.js` had `/claimed|redeemed|expired|invalid|dismissed|retries exhausted/i` as the terminal-status filter for pending-redeem lookups. `src/platforms/prime-gaming.js` had `/redeemed|expired|invalid/i` for the same purpose. When Prime successfully claims a code from Amazon but the external redemption (MS Store, GOG, Xbox etc.) still needs manual action, the entry's status is `'claimed'` — which prime-gaming.js correctly treats as pending (fires the daily notification), but panel.js wrongly treated as terminal (hidden from Alerts). Result: user gets nagged daily but has no UI to make it stop.

**Fix:** two-part.

1. Removed `claimed` from panel.js's terminal regex. Entries with status `'claimed'` now show in Alerts → Pending Redemptions with the same Mark redeemed / Dismiss buttons as other pending entries.
2. Extracted the regex to a single module-scope constant (`PRIME_PENDING_TERMINAL_RX`) referenced by all three sites in panel.js that previously each had their own copy. Drift can't recur without changing the shared constant. Filed under `feedback_no_local_shadow_of_shared_helper` — one of three panel copies used to have subtly different tokens than the other two; even after the fix, keeping three separate copies would guarantee this recurs. One authoritative constant, three references.

Affects the Alerts tab pending-redeem section, the notification-count badge (`/api/state.notifications`), and the HA `/api/hass/sensors` `pending_prime_redeems` count.

@jcubby86: after pulling `:latest` on v2.12.2+, DOOM Eternal will appear in Alerts → Pending Redemptions. Click **Mark redeemed** (you already entered the code externally) or **Dismiss** (stop nagging without confirming) to clear the daily notification.

## What's new in 2.12.1

**Fix: corrupt `data/*.json` no longer crashes the whole claim script at boot ([#156](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/156) @coolius).**

Reported live 2026-09-25: both `data/gog.json` and `data/steam.json` got zeroed out on @coolius's host (typical cause: filesystem crash / power loss / disk-full-mid-write), and every daily run for two+ weeks died at DB-load with:

```
SyntaxError: Unexpected token '', ""... is not valid JSON
    at JSONFile.parse
    at JSONFilePreset
    at file:///fgc/src/platforms/gog.js:52
```

Epic + Prime worked fine because their DBs were intact — only GOG + Steam were bricked, but nothing in fgc knew to recover.

**Fix:** wrapped the `jsonDb()` helper in `src/util.js` with a parse-error catch. On a SyntaxError-family failure, the bad file is rotated aside to `<name>.corrupt.<ISO-timestamp>` (preserving forensic evidence — never silently deleted), a warn is logged, and the DB is re-initialised with the module's default schema. Non-parse errors (EACCES, EIO, EROFS) still throw — those are ops issues that starting fresh wouldn't fix. If the rotate itself fails (rare — read-only mount, permissions), fgc falls back to deleting the bad file so the run can continue; if delete also fails, the original parse error re-throws so the user sees the real problem.

Applies to every DB fgc reads through `jsonDb()` — per-service claim DBs (steam.json, gog.json, epic-games.json, prime-gaming.json, fab.json), state files (runs.json, scheduler-state.json, discoveries-state.json, github-watch.json, quality-lookup-cache.json, etc.). One helper, one wrap, universal coverage.

**Migration:** existing corrupt files auto-recover on next run. New `<name>.corrupt.<timestamp>` files may appear alongside the fresh DBs — safe to delete once you've confirmed everything's working, or keep for debugging.

---

## What's new in 2.12.0

**Feature: cross-service Steam-lookup quality filter ([#148](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/148) @DoSpamu).**

Opt-in pre-claim gate that consults Steam as a single quality-signal source across every enabled claim script. Skips games whose Steam review-% and/or Metacritic score falls below your threshold, whose base price is at or below your price floor, or (further opt-in) that don't have a Steam page at all. Solves the "free game with 12 negative reviews still takes a library slot" problem — filters shovelware before it fills your library.

**Design (per the #148 thread, agreed with @DoSpamu):**

- **Single lookup source = Steam.** >95% of anything worth filtering also has a Steam SKU. Metacritic/OpenCritic/IGDB as primary sources have the wrong failure mode: the exact shovelware you want to filter is the stuff nobody reviewed, so those come back empty *precisely when you need them*. Steam has the broadest coverage.
- **Two independent gates, both opt-in:**
  - **Score gate:** normalise Steam review-% + Metacritic /100 to 0-10, take the LOWER of the two if both present. Skip if lowest < `quality.minScore` (default 5). Reasoning: 5 = skip clearly-bad, 8 = strict / DoSpamu-style.
  - **Price gate:** skip if base price ≤ `quality.minBasePrice` (default $2), OR game is permanently-free-to-play. Catches the "no reviews at all" shovelware category that no score filter would ever touch.
- **Third opt-in:** `quality.skipUnmatched` (default off) — skip when no Steam page found. Default off = safer (some good non-Steam-exclusive titles just aren't listed on Steam).
- **Per-service opt-in via `quality.appliesTo`** — comma-separated list of `epic-games, gog, steam, prime-gaming, fab`. Empty default = gate OFF everywhere even if `enabled=true`. Safety belt so users who enable then forget to pick services don't accidentally filter.
- **RAWG fallback deferred** per the thread — Steam-only in v1; add second lookup if the "no Steam page" gap actually bites users.

**Implementation:**

- New `src/quality-lookup.js` — three anonymous Steam API calls per uncached title (storesearch → appdetails → appreviews), results cached in `data/quality-lookup-cache.json` with a 30-day TTL. `checkQualityGate(service, title)` helper is called from all 5 claim scripts (epic-games, gog, steam, prime-gaming, fab) right at the decision point before the claim click. Silent no-op when the gate is disabled or the service isn't in `appliesTo`.
- Skipped items get a terminal DB status of `filtered:quality:<badge>` (`price`, `score`, `no-steam-page`, `free-to-play`) plus a `qualityInfo` object recording the exact scores/price that triggered the skip. Terminal marking prevents re-lookup on subsequent runs — DB fastpath short-circuits.
- One aggregate log line per run (per `feedback_aggregate_log_verbosity`): `Quality filter: checked=N passed=M skipped=K (price=X, score=Y, no-steam-page=Z)`. Silent when no games consulted the gate.
- New Settings → Advanced → **Quality filter (Steam-lookup)** group with 5 fields: enable toggle, applies-to services list, min score, min price, skip-unmatched. Env-var equivalents: `QUALITY_ENABLED`, `QUALITY_MIN_SCORE`, `QUALITY_MIN_BASE_PRICE`, `QUALITY_SKIP_UNMATCHED`, `QUALITY_APPLIES_TO` (comma-separated).

**Backward compatible:**

- All defaults OFF/EMPTY — no existing deploy silently starts filtering on upgrade.
- New DB fields (`filtered:quality:*` status, `qualityInfo` object) are additive; existing DB rows unaffected.
- Cache file created on first lookup only; nothing to migrate.

**Not shipped in v1 (follow-up ideas welcome):**

- Discoveries-tab `QUALITY` badge with per-item hover-tooltip showing the score/price that triggered the skip. Rendering works today (`filtered:quality:*` status is a valid DB state) but a proper badge with reason exposure is deferred to v2.12.1.
- Per-service score overrides (some users may want minScore=7 for Prime but minScore=4 for GOG). One global threshold in v1.
- RAWG fallback for the "no Steam page" case.

## What's new in 2.11.19

**Fix: MS Store Prime→Store redemption timeout no longer crashes the entire Prime run.**

Live report from @feldorn 2026-09-18: DOOM Eternal Prime→MS Store handoff — `page.waitForResponse: Timeout 60000ms exceeded while waiting for event "response"` — bubbled up as an unhandled exception, killed the whole Prime run mid-way, and posted a diagnostic banner requiring manual dismissal. The prior game in the same batch (Wall World 2) had already claimed successfully, so Prime itself was fine — only the MS-Store handoff choked.

**Root cause:** the two `page.waitForResponse` calls in `prime-gaming.js` for `store-web.dynamics.com/v1.0/Redeem/PrepareRedeem` and `.../RedeemToken` had no try/catch. Any 60s timeout — whether from a transient MS backend hiccup, a Cloudflare / bot-check intercept, or MS quietly deprecating `store-web.dynamics.com` in favor of the newer `redeem.microsoft.com` / `xbox.com/redeem` hosts — threw straight up out of the Prime pass.

**Fix:** wrap both `waitForResponse` calls in try/catch. On timeout the code logs cleanly (`MS Store PrepareRedeem endpoint didn't respond in 60s — redeem manually at <url>`), leaves `redeem_action` at its default `'redeem'` value — which the existing needsManual tally at line ~505 already handles as "surface the redeem URL + code so the user can redeem manually" — and falls through to the standard `page2.close()` + notification path. Same defensive pattern the login-required branch (line 424) has always used.

**Behavior change:**
- **Happy path:** unchanged (still auto-redeems successfully when MS responds).
- **Old timeout behavior:** whole Prime run dies + diagnostic banner + entire batch's downstream games (if any) skipped.
- **New timeout behavior:** the one stuck game gets marked "redeem manually" with a Pushover push containing the code + redeem URL, and every other game in the batch continues processing normally.

Not extending the same guard to the GOG paths (lines 381 + 404) in this ship — no reports there, staying scope-tight. Will iterate if GOG's endpoints start timing out too.

---

## What's new in 2.11.18

**Fix: GamerPower manual-action pushes no longer fire daily for the same giveaway ([#119](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/119) xh43k follow-up).**

@xh43k reported daily Pushover notifications for **"SWAPMEAT Steam Game Key Giveaway (via GamerPower)"** — an Alienware Arena promo that GamerPower labels "Steam" (the key is for a Steam game) but distributes via `alienwarearena.com/ucf/show/...` under an ARP-points redemption gate. fgc's Steam runner didn't have a Steam `/app/<id>/` URL to visit, so it fell through to the manual-action notify path — and that path had no dedup. Every daily run re-pushed the same "claim manually" alert for the same expired/locked giveaway.

**Fix:** synthesise a `manual::<matchkey>` row in `data/steam.json` with `status: 'notified:manual-action'` on first surfacing. Subsequent runs short-circuit before the `notify_games.push` — one notification per giveaway per fgc install, then silence forever (or until the user deletes the row to re-notify, which is rare — by then the promo has usually ended anyway). Discoveries-tab visibility is unaffected: the tab renders manual-action items separately, so users can still see them if they want to try claiming through the aggregator's platform.

Same terminal-marking pattern used for `skipped:requires-base-game` in v2.8.79 (also from #119) and `skipped:not-free` in the price-filter path. Reuses the existing Steam DB — no new file, no new schema.

**Migration note for existing deploys:** entries that got re-notified before v2.11.18 will now stop after their next run (which writes the synthetic row). No manual cleanup needed.

---

## What's new in 2.11.17

**Fix: Epic goto hang when a previous game's checkout modal is still open ([#151](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/151) hyperactive68 on v2.11.16).**

Similar failure shape to [#104](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/104) / v2.11.15's launcher-modal fix, but a different modal. Concrete case from hyperactive68: Rival Stars Horse Racing claimed successfully (via post-click CTA recovery), then Down in Bermuda's primary success race timed out because Epic now surfaces a **"Checkout — Add to library"** iframe modal on-page (same shape as FAB's checkout — it's Epic-Games-hosted checkout code). Our success race never sees the ownership CTA flip, marks Down in Bermuda failed, and the next iteration's `page.goto` (for Down in Bermuda's iOS variant — the game was in the queue twice via different platform URLs) hits `Timeout 60000ms exceeded` because the still-open modal's iframe pins the top-level `domcontentloaded` event. The exception then unwinds the whole Epic pass, losing every downstream game in the queue.

**Two mitigations, both shipped:**

1. **`waitUntil: 'commit'`** on the claim-loop `page.goto` (was `'domcontentloaded'` in v2.11.15). Playwright's `'commit'` returns the instant Playwright receives response headers, before any DOM parse — including sub-frame parsing — has to complete. Safe here because the very next line is a `waitForFunction` on the purchase CTA button, which is the real "wait for content" gate.

2. **Treat `page.goto: Timeout Xms exceeded` as recoverable** in `isRecoverableEpicPageError`. If a goto still times out despite (1), the existing recoverable-error path logs the failure, skips that one game, and continues the queue instead of exceptioning out the whole Epic run.

**Not fixed here:** the *primary* reason Down in Bermuda's success race timed out — Epic's new on-page checkout iframe isn't recognised by the current `#webPurchaseContainer iframe` selector, so the `RX_ADD_LIBRARY` click never fires against it. Rival Stars only survived via the CTA-recovery probe. Follow-up work: teach the modal-click path to fall through to an all-frames "Add to library" scan when the primary iframe doesn't materialise, parallel to what v2.11.11 did for FAB (#127). Landing in a subsequent release — v2.11.17 keeps the existing behaviour working and stops the whole-run-crash, which is the acute bug.

---

## What's new in 2.11.16

Two independent fixes reported the same day.

**Fix: FAB now handles the EU "Right of Withdrawal Information" modal ([#149](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/149) 4n4n4s, [#127](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/127) @Steggl followup).**

FAB's Epic-hosted checkout iframe now shows an EU consumer-protection modal *after* the "Add to library" click but *before* the checkout completes. Buttons are `Cancel` / `I accept`. Text: *"By selecting 'I accept', you agree to the immediate delivery of or provisional access to the digital content or subscription service you are purchasing. By doing so, you will lose your 14-day cancellation right granted by law."*

Only fires for EU accounts, which is why 4n4n4s and @Steggl (both EU) hit it and non-EU testing missed it. Confirmed against Steggl's `2.11.14` failure log (3 games × ~3m22s per failure = full 60s CTA timeout budget × retries) — his "Add to library" clicks were succeeding thanks to v2.11.11's iframe-scan fix, but the modal blocked the ownership-flip that our success race waits on.

**Fix:** after the "Add to library" click, run a second 15s race for an "I accept" button across the same page + child-frames scopes. Clicks it if found; silent no-op for non-EU users (button never appears, race exits without spam). Uses same all-frames-scan pattern as the place-order race so the modal-in-iframe case Just Works.

Localised label variants (German etc.) will be added when the first live report from a non-English EU account arrives.

**Fix: Steam Family Sharing claim path ([#147](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/147) QuasiForEver, @Steggl diagnosis).**

When another member of the user's Steam Family already owns a game, Steam shows an **"IN STEAM FAMILY LIBRARY"** banner with **"A member of your Steam Family already owns this game"** copy, and replaces the standard "Add to Account" green button with a **"Get {game_name}"** button. The game is free-to-add for the family member — but our detection only looks for the paid-purchase `.discount_final_price` block (which says `$X.XX`, not "Free") and the standard `Add to Account` button (which isn't there). Result: fgc skipped it as "not currently free on store page" while the user was in fact eligible to claim it.

**Fix:** detect the Family Sharing banner (locale-portable regex). When present, override `isFree=true`, look for a `Get {…}` button inside the purchase-area container (bounded so an unrelated `Get X` elsewhere on the page can't false-positive), and route the click through that button instead of the standard green one. New `familySharing` flag surfaces on the details object so the log line reads `Family Sharing claim path (family member owns; adding to account for free)` at click time — differentiates the two flows in the audit trail.

Credit to @Steggl for the "family-library banner" observation — without that specific string, the "Get X vs Add to Account" branch would have been much slower to isolate.

## What's new in 2.11.15

**Fix: Epic post-claim "FINAL STEP — Is Epic Games Launcher installed?" modal hung the next-game navigation for 60s → whole Epic run erroring out.**

Reported live 2026-08-28: today's Epic run successfully claimed *Rival Stars Horse Racing: Desktop Edition*, then Epic popped up a launcher-install upsell modal that we didn't dismiss. On the next iteration `page.goto(nextGame)` waited on the default `load` event, which never fired because the previous page's modal iframes/scripts held it open. Playwright timed out after 60s, Epic errored, run marker never updated. Steam/Ubisoft/etc. downstream in the chain kept going fine.

**Two mitigations, both shipped:**

1. **Restore `waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded'`** on the claim-loop `page.goto`. That event fires as soon as DOM parse finishes, well before trailing modal assets load. Was commented out at some point in history (unclear when) — the DOM state Epic delivers by domcontentloaded is more than enough for our next step (finding the purchase CTA).

2. **New `dismissLauncherModal(page)` helper** called after every successful claim (main success path, recovery-via-CTA path, and retry-loop success path). Best-effort race across localised heading + a few dismiss button variants (`Yes, it's installed`, close button, Escape). Zero cost when the modal isn't present (locator short-circuits). No error path — the domcontentloaded change already makes the next goto robust to the modal existing; the dismiss is belt-and-suspenders.

**Impact on the failing run:** Rival Stars was still successfully claimed (already in the library). Games 3-5 in today's queue (post-Rival-Stars) will be picked up on tomorrow's scheduled run.

Filed the modal-selectors under `epic-games.js` at module scope so the pattern is discoverable next time Epic invents a new post-claim surface.

## What's new in 2.11.14

**Feature: `/api/hass/sensors` now returns a `recent_claims` array (D#145 @Steggl follow-up).**

The v2.11.12 auth work moved `/api/activity` behind the session-cookie gate. Home Assistant's rest platform doesn't easily do cookie-based auth, so Steggl's HA integration lost the recent-claims list even though the counter fields on the unauth `/api/hass/sensors` endpoint kept working.

**Fix:** the sensors endpoint now includes `recent_claims: [{title, service, service_name, claimed_at, store_url, status}, ...]` — up to 10 rows, same shape as `/api/activity` but with HA-template-friendly key names (`claimed_at` / `store_url`). Same payload, one call, no auth. HA `rest` platform reads via `value_template: "{{ value_json.recent_claims }}"` and rest_sensor children can pull `.[0].title`, `.[0].store_url`, etc.

Nothing else changes on the endpoint — the counter/status/active_services surface is unchanged. Users on 2.11.12/2.11.13 with an HA integration only need to pull `:latest` and their template can start referencing the new key.

## What's new in 2.11.13

**Hotfix: v2.11.12 client JS syntax error — panel got stuck at "Loading…".**

The v2.11.12 Web-UI Auth section included an inline `onclick="window.open('...', '_blank')"` docs link. That HTML lived inside a JS single-quoted string, which lived inside the outer PANEL_HTML template literal. My `\'` escape survived the template-literal collapse as a bare `'`, which then terminated the surrounding JS string. Every browser dumped the script with `SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier 'https'`, the client bootstrap never ran, and the Sessions-tab placeholder never advanced past "Loading…". Reported live on iPad Brave.

**Fix:** replaced the `onclick`+`window.open` link with a plain `<a href="…" target="_blank" rel="noopener">` anchor. Zero `'` in the HTML → nothing to escape → nothing to break. Verified by piping the served client-JS through `node --check` (added the same check to my pre-push script). Everything else in the Auth section (Settings UI, set-password, disable-auth, noVNC proxy) is unchanged from v2.11.12.

Filed under `feedback_panel_html_no_backticks` — the standing rule "no inner backticks in PANEL_HTML" got a companion: **no bare single quotes inside a JS single-quoted string** either. `onclick="fn('…')"` in inline HTML is the specific trap; use `<a href>`, or entity-encode the apostrophes as `&#39;`, or move the handler to a named function referenced by an id.

Landing on v2.11.13 rather than a re-tag of v2.11.12 so users on the update banner see an unambiguously-newer version — v2.11.12 itself sat on GHCR for a few minutes broken; the update-check would otherwise report "already on latest" for anyone who pulled during that window.

---

## What's new in 2.11.12

**Feature: full Web-UI authentication with noVNC-through-panel proxy ([D#145](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/discussions/145) — @Steggl asked for a login screen so the panel can be exposed to the internet via reverse proxy).**

Enabling authentication now protects **both** the panel on `:7080` **and** the noVNC browser view. When you turn auth on, the panel starts proxying noVNC under its own same-origin `/novnc/*` prefix — one session cookie gates the panel HTTP endpoints, the noVNC static assets, and the raw VNC framebuffer over WebSocket. Users can then close the direct `:6080` publish in their compose entirely and keep noVNC available through their authenticated reverse proxy.

**What ships:**

- **Settings → Web UI Auth** — new section shows the current auth state, its source (config-hash / env / none), and offers an enable/change-password form. Passwords are bcrypt-hashed server-side (never stored plaintext, never emitted in `/api/config` or `/api/state`). Changing the password logs out every session including your own — you're bounced back to the login page.
- **noVNC proxy** — `/novnc/*` on the panel origin serves the noVNC UI + `/novnc/websockify` upgrades to the raw VNC framebuffer, all through the panel process, all gated by the same session cookie. When auth is off, direct `:6080` still works exactly as it did before.
- **Session hardening** — sessions persist to `data/panel-sessions.json` (mode 0600) so container restarts don't invalidate browser cookies. 24-hour TTL with sliding renewal at 1 hour idle. Cookie carries `Max-Age=86400` and the `Secure` flag when `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` is present or `PUBLIC_URL` starts `https://`. `SameSite=Strict` preserved for CSRF coverage.
- **Rate limit** — `/api/auth` locks out an IP after 5 failed attempts / 15 min with a clear "Try again in Nm" message. Success resets the counter. Applies to the set-password current-password check too, so brute-force can't sneak in through that route either.
- **Logout endpoint** — `POST /api/logout` invalidates the server-side token and clears the cookie.
- **Security headers** — `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` on every JSON response, `X-Frame-Options: DENY` on the login page (clickjacking protection for the credential form), `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` on the panel body (still iframe-able from same-origin dashboards — Organizr / Homepage / Heimdall / SWAG subfolders — but not from third-party sites).
- **Body-size cap** — `parseBody()` now caps at 100 KB → 413 on overflow. Unrelated hardening, low-cost in the same file.

**Backward compatibility:**

- **`PANEL_PASSWORD` env plaintext still works.** The panel bcrypt-hashes it at boot into a memory-only variable — never stored. If both env plaintext and a Settings-configured hash are set, the config-hash wins.
- **Auth off (existing default) is byte-identical behavior.** Every gate short-circuits when no hash resolves. Users on `:6080` direct-access setups don't need to change anything.
- **CSRF:** cookie is `SameSite=Strict` which fully blocks cross-site request abuse. Explicit CSRF tokens deferred — SameSite covers the single-user threat model.

**Load-bearing caveat you should know about:** if you keep `:6080` published in your compose file **AND** enable panel auth, direct hits to `http://host:6080` still work and are NOT gated by the panel password. If you're exposing fgc to the internet, close that port at your firewall or in your `docker-compose.yml` (comment out `- "6080:6080"` — noVNC still works via the panel proxy). Left publish alone if you use LAN-only.

**Reverse-proxy note:** ensure your proxy sets `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` when the client connection is HTTPS — that signal drives the `Secure` cookie flag. SWAG, Traefik, and Caddy do this by default; some NPM configs need it added explicitly.

Docs: `docs/PANEL.md` gains an Authentication section, `docs/NETWORKING.md` gains a note about closing `:6080` once you've verified the proxied noVNC works.

## What's new in 2.11.11

**Fix: FAB checkout CTA race now searches child iframes, not just the main page ([#127](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/127) — Duwaynef on v2.11.10).**

Duwaynef reported v2.11.10 still failing on FAB's Nordic Fishing Hut listing with `no place-order CTA matched any known label`. Their attached screenshot decisively shows an "Add to library" button clearly rendered in a modal headed **"Checkout"** with an **Epic Games logo** in the top-left. Every one of v2.11.6's 12 candidate labels was present in the DOM — but not the main-frame DOM. FAB (Epic-owned since Epic's 2024 acquisition) has evidently moved its €0 checkout modal into an Epic-Games-hosted iframe.

Playwright's `page.locator()` scopes to the main frame; a locator that looks for a button in an iframe returns zero hits. That's why the entire 15s race timed out with the button visible on-screen.

**Fix:** the checkout candidate race now iterates over `[page, ...page.frames().filter(f => f !== page.mainFrame())]` — main-frame-first (preserves prior fast path) then every child iframe. Debug logging annotates the matched scope (`Add to library (text) @ frame(https://…)`), and the failure diagnostic dumps the child-frame URLs seen so a subsequent report can pinpoint which Epic iframe hosts the modal.

Backward compatible for the pre-iframe FAB flow: if the button is in the main frame (older listings, or non-Epic ones), the main-frame check wins the race on the first inner loop just as it did before.

Zero user action needed post-upgrade. Existing users on v2.11.10 who were hitting this specific "checkout modal renders but v2.11.10 never clicks" trap will start claiming these listings automatically.

## What's new in 2.11.10

**Feature: collect additional Microsoft Rewards points from the new-UI 'Keep earning' section ([PR #144](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/pull/144) — credit @keloru).**

Two new-UI point sources are now harvested that v2.11.x wasn't touching:

1. **`#moreactivities` (Keep earning) section walk.** The new-UI activity walker previously covered `#dailyset` and `#exploreonbing`. Cards in the `#moreactivities` block — the "Keep earning" section beneath the daily set — were being left on the table. Added as a third pass with the same click-and-sleep cadence as the other two sections.

2. **Default-search-engine bonus.** First daily Bing search now uses the `bing.com?FORM=CHROMN&PC=U316&q=` URL that mimics Chromium's built-in Bing default. This unlocks the small daily bonus MS grants for using Bing as the browser's default search engine. Subsequent searches keep the existing behaviour.

**Live-account verification on my end:** `attempted=13 clicked=13 errors=0` across dailyset+exploreonbing+moreactivities on both desktop and mobile passes. `+100` point desktop delta preserved. No timeouts, no selector misses.

**Backward compatible.** Existing users see zero behavioural change on old-UI accounts (feature-detects the new UI first). Users on new-UI accounts will start seeing more points harvested per run automatically — no config toggle needed.

---

## What's new in 2.11.9

**Fix: MS Rewards ran despite the parent toggle being off — parent-gate semantic broken by an OR check + `microsoft-mobile.defaultActive: true`.**

Reported live 2026-08-08: user had Microsoft Rewards toggled OFF in Settings, yet MS Rewards ran at 08:58 that morning.

**Root cause:** four places in the scheduler used `active.has('microsoft') || active.has('microsoft-mobile')` as the MS-active check. The registry declares `microsoft-mobile.defaultActive: true` (via `src/sites.js`). Users who never explicitly touched the mobile sub-toggle have no `services.microsoft-mobile.active` entry in `config.json`, so `activeServices()` returns `microsoft-mobile` as active *from the default*. Even when the parent `microsoft` was set to `false`, the OR gate saw mobile as active and let the fire through.

The registry hint on the "Run mobile session" sub-toggle explicitly says *"Unchecking the parent Microsoft Rewards toggle above disables both desktop and mobile together"* — the intended semantic. The OR check contradicted it.

**Fix:** all four MS-active checks now use only `active.has('microsoft')`. Parent-gate semantic. `microsoft-mobile` is a **sub-toggle** consumed by `microsoft.js` at runtime (whether to run the mobile pass in addition to desktop) — it doesn't fire independently and never has. Fixed in:

- `legacyCombinedMode()` — legacy chain no longer fires MS when parent is off
- `computeMsWakeMs()` — MS wake-computation returns null when parent is off
- `msSchedulerLoop()` — per-wake fire-check now correctly gates on parent alone
- `getState()` — panel status reflects real MS-active state

Backward compatible for the common case (both microsoft and microsoft-mobile toggled together, which is what the linked-active writer in Settings has always done). Fixes the edge case where microsoft-mobile has no explicit false entry and defaults to true from the registry.

## What's new in 2.11.8

**Fix: anchored main scheduler now retries today's anchor for 2h when blocked, instead of skipping straight to tomorrow ([#142](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/142) amphoterism).**

Concrete failure amphoterism reported: main claim chain scheduled Thursday 11:10, MS Rewards started 11:11 and ran to 12:07. Main tried to fire at 11:10, got blocked (lock held by MS), backed off 10 min per prior behaviour — but on the next loop iteration, `computeMainWakeMs()` saw 11:10 was past and advanced to Friday 11:10. **Today's main run was silently lost until amphoterism manually triggered it at 13:05.**

Fix: when a fire is blocked in **anchored mode** (`dailyStartTime` set), stay on today's anchor and retry every 10 min for up to 2 hours before giving up. When the retry loop times out (fire never succeeded in 2h), an explicit `abandoned today's <HH:MM> anchor after 2h retry window` log line fires so the abandonment is visible rather than silent.

Non-anchored (bare LOOP) mode is unaffected — its next-wake anchor is completion-relative (`lastMainCompletedAt + intervalMs`), not calendar-clock, so the "advance to tomorrow" trap doesn't apply. Same 10-min backoff still fires there to prevent log-spam per @dabziuebu4egh2's [#62](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/62).

MS scheduler already handles blocked fires correctly (per-day randomized pick within window; blocked attempts re-pick or mark 'missed'). Unchanged.

**2h retry window rationale:** long enough to cover a typical MS Rewards run (30-60 min) plus a batch redeem (variable), short enough that it doesn't collide with the next daily anchor even on aggressive intervals.

## What's new in 2.11.7

**Polish release — three findings from the automated review of v2.11.4..v2.11.6.**

- **Epic recovery-probe stability check now uses an explicit 3s timeout on the second `innerText()` read** (`src/platforms/epic-games.js:711`). Without it, a page-nav or DOM-detach during the 3s stability gap would fall through to the default `context.setDefaultTimeout` (60s) — the recovery would silently block for ~63s per game on a detached CTA instead of the intended ~4s. Cheap correctness fix.
- **`isOwnedText(t)` predicate hoisted to module scope** (`src/platforms/epic-games.js:44`). The same "is this button text one of the known owned-state strings" check was re-implemented in four places (initial CTA, recheck, success race, recovery probe), and drift had already started — the `loading` filter was present in some copies, absent in others. Now one canonical predicate, callers replaced.
- **`src/platforms/fab.js`: dropped the three casing variants** of "Add to library" — Playwright's `:has-text()` is case-insensitive, so `Add to Library` and `Add To Library` were functionally identical to `Add to library`. Cleanup only, no behavior change.

No user-visible functionality change. Steggl's #141 v2.11.5 stability check + #127 v2.11.6 FAB fix both apply as before; this release just tightens the internal geometry.

---

## What's new in 2.11.6

**Fix: FAB checkout button "Add to library" was missing from the selector candidate list ([#127](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/127) followup, screenshot from @Steggl).**

Same pattern Epic went through in 2026-05-28 (amphoterism's [#59](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/59)): FAB's €0 checkout modal now uses "Add to library" as the confirm button. v2.9.1 broadened the selector list to 10 candidates (Place Order / Complete Order / Confirm / Get it now / Checkout / Buy Now dialog / etc.) — but not "Add to library". Every user hitting the €0 checkout flow was silently stuck at the 15s candidate-race timeout.

Steggl's screenshot dropped the disambiguation: the button was literally labeled `Add to library`, right there in plain sight. Added it as the first candidate in the race (both `getByRole` for accessibility-tree matching and the standard `has-text` variants — with and without "my" — for text-based matching).

FAB renders this button in English regardless of browser locale, so no locale variants needed. Note: "Add to My Library" (with "my") is the CATALOG-page button that's a different flow branch — this fix targets specifically the CHECKOUT modal variant, which drops the "my".

---

## What's new in 2.11.5

**Fix: recovery-probe transient-owned-state false positive on non-English Epic (Steggl's [#141](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/141) round 3).**

v2.11.4 fixed v2.11.3's post-click race by dropping the disabled-attribute shortcut. But the failure-recovery probe (which runs when the race times out) still uses text-based owned-state detection — and my v2.11.4 change made that probe locale-aware. On Steggl's German browser, Epic's checkout can flash "In der Bibliothek" (In library) transiently during a failed transaction — cart created → server rollback → back to "Holen" (Get). The probe caught the fleeting owned state and declared success; the DB got marked claimed for a game that wasn't.

Fix: stability check. If the probe sees an owned-state string, wait 3 seconds and re-read the same button. Only trust the recovery signal if both reads still show owned. Transient states won't survive the 3s gap; real ownership sticks.

Also logs an info line when the CTA flashes owned but doesn't stabilize, so if this recurs users can share the log for a proper diagnosis.

**DB-poisoning note for users upgrading from v2.11.3:** entries wrongly marked `claimed` by that version will not be re-checked by v2.11.5. If you have games showing as "already claimed" in the log but not actually in your Epic library, open `data/epic-games.json` and delete those entries — next run will re-attempt them cleanly.

---

## What's new in 2.11.4

**Fix: false-positive "claimed!" logs on Epic Games — Steggl's [#141](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/141) followup, my v2.11.3 regression.**

v2.11.3 added `if (btn.disabled) return true;` to the Epic success race, thinking a disabled purchase-CTA button = "already in library". That's true BEFORE clicking (correct v2.11.1 fix, still in place for the initial check), but AFTER clicking Epic disables the same button during the loading spinner. The success race triggered instantly on the loading state and logged "claimed!" while the click was still processing.

Symptoms Steggl caught:
- Log shows `✓ Guidebook Of Babel — claimed!` after 23s (normal ~130s), then the SAME title reappears in the loop with a second `→ claiming` attempt (because the DB wasn't actually updated, the second-pass check saw it as un-owned)
- Games not actually in the library despite the "claimed!" line
- On Spider Fox this happened in German too — locale wasn't the trigger, my regression was

Fix: text-only detection in the post-click race + failure recovery probe. The initial pre-click check keeps the `disabled` shortcut (that's a valid already-owned signal, no click has happened yet). Post-click: only trust modal text or CTA-text transitioning to a known "owned" string. Same-trap in the recovery probe fixed the same way.

I should have caught this in review — the two "disabled" states weren't visually different in the diff. Filing a memory note so it doesn't happen again.

---

## What's new in 2.11.3

**Epic Games full-flow locale portability — Steggl's [#141](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/141) followup.**

v2.11.1 fixed the initial "already owned" check for non-English browsers by adding the button's `disabled` attribute as a structural signal + a locale-variant text table. That got OTXO past the CTA click on Steggl's German setup — but Sol Cesto then stalled 180s on the **next** step. Epic's checkout modal cascades through 5+ button clicks after the CTA, and all of those were English-only:

- "Continue" (Device not supported gate)
- "Yes, buy now" (edition-conflict gate)
- "Accept" / "I Accept" (EULA + EU consent)
- "Add to Library" / "Place Order" (the main checkout button — this is where Sol Cesto stalled, German "Zur Bibliothek hinzufügen")
- "Continue browsing" / "Download launcher" (success modal)
- Success text "Thanks for your order" / "It's all yours" (success race)

All of these now go through regex-based `hasText` matchers with English + German variants (plus opportunistic French / Spanish / Italian / Portuguese / Polish / Turkish / Japanese / Korean / Chinese where documented). The `OWNED_TEXTS` table and `RX_*` variant tables are hoisted to module scope so both the main claim path and the retry pass share them.

Additionally, the `disabled` attribute now short-circuits the success race — if the CTA button flips to disabled AT ALL, that's a locale-portable "claim succeeded" signal even when the modal text race misses.

**Backward compatible.** English users see zero change. Every other locale gets partial-to-full coverage; if a new locale surfaces in an issue, one regex edit at the top of `src/platforms/epic-games.js` covers it (extend the `RX_*` groups + the `OWNED_TEXTS_GLOBAL` array).

## What's new in 2.11.2

**Path anchors moved out of util.js into a leaf module ([PR #140](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/pull/140) by @mateusfn98).**

`ROOT_DIR` / `DATA_DIR` used to live in `src/util.js`, which itself reads `cfg` from `config.js` at module scope. `src/app-config.js` sits on the `sites.js → config.js` side of the `config.js ↔ util.js` cycle, so it couldn't reach the anchors through util.js without closing the cycle (would land in TDZ mid-boot). It re-implemented the alias resolution by hand.

New `src/paths.js` is a leaf module with no local imports — it exports `ROOT_DIR`, `DATA_DIR`, `dataDir()`, `rootDir()`, and `platformFile()`. Every caller now goes through it (util.js keeps re-exporting `dataDir`/`rootDir` so existing imports still work). `app-config.js` drops its by-hand alias resolution.

`platformFile()` adds a real charset check on the runner name — specifiers parse as URLs, so an unchecked `#` or `?` truncates the path silently (`a#b.js` resolves to `a`). `normalizeClaimSegment()` screens `CLAIM_CMD` words against the same regex — an unrecognized name like `my_tool.js` reaches the shell instead of throwing mid-run.

Also fixes a subtle cleanup: `writeJournalEntry()` (from the v2.11.0 notifications journal) was reaching for the top-level `DATA_DIR` const directly; now goes through `dataDir()` for consistency with everyone else.

Fourth PR from @mateusfn98 (after #136, #138, #139). Refactor-only — no behavior change for anyone.

## What's new in 2.11.1

**Discoveries tab now shows every notify-only watcher's items alongside GamerPower + FGF, with cross-source dedup.**

Prior to this release, the Discoveries tab surfaced only GamerPower + r/FreeGameFindings entries. Notify-only watchers (IndieGala, PSN, Xbox, Fanatical, Humble Bundle, Lenovo Gaming Key Drops, Ubisoft) fired apprise pushes but were invisible in the panel. That was a design gap — the whole point of the Discoveries tab is to be the one place fgc reports every item it has found.

**What changed:**

- New `src/discoveries.js` module reads every `data/*-watch.json` state file and folds the tracked products into the same aggregation pipeline as GamerPower + FGF entries.
- Cross-source dedup with priority: **direct watchers (IndieGala/PSN/Xbox/Fanatical/Humble/Lenovo/Ubisoft) > GamerPower > FGF**. If the same game is reported by multiple sources, one row shows the direct-storefront claim URL, and secondary sources get small "+GP" / "+FGF" pills for provenance.
- Every source has its own bucket in `/api/discoveries` — GamerPower, FGF, plus one per watcher.
- Meta line shows counts per source: `Fetched 10:30:12 · GamerPower: 17 · FGF: 8 · IndieGala: 6 · Xbox: 13 · Showing 30 of 44`.
- Row rendering: watcher-sourced items show `first seen YYYY-MM-DD` metadata instead of the GamerPower/FGF-specific "worth" / "upvotes" lines.
- Coverage badges added for the newly-recognized collectors: `psn`, `xbox`, `fanatical`, `humble-bundle`, `lenovo-gaming` all render as `NOTIFY` with an appropriate label.

**Impact:** the Discoveries tab is now the actual "everything fgc has found" view it was always intended to be. Notification-journal (v2.11.0) tells you *what pinged you*; Discoveries tells you *what fgc has visibility on* — those two views together, plus the Alerts summary, give you complete situational awareness without SSH-ing to a container.

**No config changes required.** Existing user-state markers (ignore / mark manually-claimed) still work — the dedup keys are stable across the retrofit.

**No new env vars.** No new opt-ins. Purely a rendering + aggregation change.

---

## What's new in 2.11.0

**Batch feature release — 3 new notify-only watchers, Prime→Steam auto-redeem, opt-in CAPTCHA helper, Steam Points Shop weekly item, pause/resume scheduler, plus MS Rewards resilience fixes. Ships on top of the [PR #139](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/pull/139) repository reorganisation.**

### Repository layout ([PR #139](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/pull/139) by @mateusfn98)

Claim scrapers now live in `src/platforms/`; the panel server is now `src/panel/panel.js`. Existing `CLAIM_CMD` / `CLAIM_CMD_MANUAL` env values still work — a compatibility resolver rewrites `gog`, `gog.js`, `node gog.js`, and full-path forms to the new locations at boot (covered by `test/claim-cmd.js`). Subpath aliases `#src/*`, `#platforms/*`, `#dataDir`, `#rootDir` are declared in `package.json`. Node engines bumped to `>=20.6.0` for synchronous `import.meta.resolve` — Docker users are unaffected. Third consecutive PR from @mateusfn98 — thanks.

### New notify-only watchers

- **IndieGala** (`src/platforms/indiegala.js`). Public freebies.indiegala.com scraper with API interception + DOM fallback. Runs alongside the existing GamerPower discovery — same site-registry pattern, same aggregated notification body, dedup key `indiegala::<matchKey(stripped)>`. Off by default; toggle in Settings → IndieGala.
- **PSN / PlayStation Plus** (`src/platforms/psn-watcher.js`) — GamerPower-backed filter on `\bps[3-5]\b|playstation`. Zero-auth (no browser needed), same aggregated notification. Off by default. This is the notify-only follow-through on the closed [PR #55](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/pull/55) — auto-claim is infeasible (Sony fingerprinting), but "ping me when new PS Plus lands so I can claim on my console" is not.
- **Xbox / Game Pass** (`src/platforms/xbox-watcher.js`) — same shape for `\bxbox\b`. Catches Free Play Days, GwG rotations, promo drops.

### Prime → Steam auto-redeem (opt-in)

`PG_STEAM_AUTOREDEEM=1` enables the drain path: Prime captures Steam keys to a shared queue at `data/pending-steam-keys.json`; the following `steam.js` run posts each key to `store.steampowered.com/account/registerkey` using the authenticated Steam session. Same daily loop (Prime claimOrder 2 → Steam claimOrder 4), so keys ship same-day. Retries transient failures up to 5 attempts across days; permanent failures (already owned, invalid code, region-locked) drop from the queue with a notification. Off by default — leave off to keep the manual-redeem-URL notification path.

### CAPTCHA opt-in helper (`src/captcha.js`)

Provider-agnostic `solveHcaptcha` / `solveRecaptcha` / `attemptAutoSolveHcaptcha` — 2Captcha REST as the initial provider. Zero effect when unconfigured (`CAPTCHA_API_KEY` unset → helpers return null, callers keep today's fail-and-diagnostic behaviour). Call-site wiring in EG/FAB deferred pending real captured captcha surface. Helper contract is documented in the file — third-party callers or forks can wire it into any script with `if (const token = await solveHcaptcha(page, {siteKey, url}); token) …`.

### Steam Points Shop free weekly item (opt-in)

`STEAM_POINTS_SHOP_WEEKLY=1` enables best-effort weekly claim of the free Points Shop item (badge / animated avatar frame / sticker). ISO-week dedup in `data/steam.json`. Runs at the tail of the Steam claim pass. Never fatal — the Points Shop layout is more variable than the main store, so failures log and continue.

### MS Rewards — locale-portable point-balance read + zero-credit abort ([#135](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/135) @dabziuebu4egh2)

- `readPointsBalance` gains aria-label variants for Spanish/Portuguese/Italian/German/Polish/Hungarian/Finnish/Norwegian/Czech/Russian/Chinese/Japanese/Korean, plus locale-portable text labels ("Puntos disponibles", "Points disponibles", "Verfügbare Punkte", etc.). RSC path remains the primary reader — this is fallback coverage.
- **Zero-credit abort in the search loop.** Every 8 completed searches, `executeBingSearches` re-reads the balance via RSC. If the balance hasn't moved off the starting value, Bing is silently rejecting points for this account/region (per @dabziuebu4egh2's report: searches ran, `Points after +0`) — the loop aborts to reduce anti-bot footprint. The user sees a warn line and MS runs less brittle-ly on the next attempt.

Quiz automation, punch-card completion, and streak-protection heuristics: deferred pending live-account test infrastructure. The existing card-click flow already fires quiz cards on click — points credit on any subsequent Bing engagement, so this is not a regression, just leaves the "point per quiz" ceiling on the table.

### Pause/resume scheduler (long-promised in `docs/PANEL.md`)

Schedule tab now shows a **Pause** / **Resume** toggle at the very top. State persists across panel restarts (in `data/scheduler-state.json`). While paused, `fireScheduledRun` skips every scheduled wake — main + MS + digest + Lenovo drops + GitHub watch — with a single log line and no side effects. **Missed runs do NOT retro-fire on resume** (per `feedback_missed_runs_manual_recovery`) — use the per-service Run buttons on the Sessions tab to catch up on whatever you want to run.

### Site registry changes

- New site entries: `indiegala`, `psn-watcher`, `xbox-watcher` (all `scheduleKind: 'watch-only'`, opt-in, notify-only).
- Full claim order: `prime-gaming` (2), `gog` (2.5), `epic-games` (3), `fab` (3.5), `steam` (4), `aliexpress` (5), `ubisoft` (6), `humble-bundle` (7), `fanatical` (8), `psn-watcher` (8.3), `xbox-watcher` (8.4), `indiegala` (8.5), `microsoft` (9), `lenovo-gaming` (10).
- Prime Gaming config field added: `steamAutoredeem` toggle (PG_STEAM_AUTOREDEEM).

### Env vars added

`PG_STEAM_AUTOREDEEM`, `INDIEGALA_ACTIVE`, `PSN_ACTIVE`, `XBOX_ACTIVE`, `INDIEGALA_PAGE_URL`, `CAPTCHA_PROVIDER`, `CAPTCHA_API_KEY`, `STEAM_POINTS_SHOP_WEEKLY`.

### What did NOT ship

- Real quiz-answer automation for MS Rewards (needs live account for reliable selectors).
- Punch-card multi-step orchestration (same reason).
- EG hCaptcha + FAB checkout captcha call-site integration (helper ships; call-site wiring deferred pending captured captcha shape).
- Streak-protection heuristics (requires per-account daily-cap knowledge).

Ships on the site-registry pattern; every new watcher is one entry in `src/sites.js` plus one file in `src/platforms/`. Same shape as fanatical/humble/lenovo — nothing new to learn for a maintainer touching one of these.

### Known fragility — please report if any of this breaks

This release covers a lot of new surface. Some paths are only lightly validated. If you hit any of these, please file an issue (or a diagnostic Share from the Alerts tab) — real-world feedback is exactly what the maintainer testing couldn't produce.

- **IndieGala watcher (v0.1).** DOM-fallback selectors were built by inspecting `freebies.indiegala.com` on release day (six free items visible: Game Of Mafia, Bad cat Sam, Whiskey.Mafia Leo's Family, Blacklist Mafia, Scamster Kombat, Die Young Prologue). Card layout has moved before and will move again. Symptom: the log line "IndieGala responded but no free items visible right now" while the storefront clearly has games. If that recurs, the DOM structure changed — please share the run log.
- **PSN + Xbox watchers (v0.1).** Depend on GamerPower's `platforms` field containing recognizable console substrings (`Playstation 4/5`, `Xbox One`, `Xbox Series X|S`). Both use the un-filtered `?type=game`-omitted API endpoint since most console freebies are typed `DLC` / `Loot`. If GamerPower renames platforms or drops the entries entirely from this endpoint, these fall silent.
- **Prime→Steam auto-redeem (2A).** End-to-end happy path is **untested** — we never had a real Steam key from Amazon during the release window to redeem for real. The queue write path, drain loop, retry accounting, and permanent-vs-transient failure branching are all in place, but the actual `#register_btn` click landing on Steam's success page has not been observed on this branch. First real trip may expose response-shape edge cases.
- **Steam Points Shop weekly (2E).** Marked "best-effort" for a reason: the Points Shop is a heavy React SPA and my selectors may miss when the page hasn't fully hydrated. Log line "Steam Points Shop: no free items visible this week" while a free badge/frame is actually available means the timing or selector didn't match. Rewrite candidate for a follow-up.
- **CAPTCHA helper (2D).** Zero call-site integration in this release — the helper exists, the config env vars are honored, but no site currently calls `solveHcaptcha`/`solveRecaptcha`. So it's effectively dead code until a follow-up wires EG/FAB to use it. Safe: guaranteed no behavior change vs 2.10.1.
- **MS Rewards zero-credit abort.** Only fires on accounts that match the #135 pattern (Bing accepts searches but silently credits 0 points, typically region-gated). Healthy accounts won't see it. If your MS run aborts mid-loop with the message "Zero-credit abort: after N searches, balance unchanged," check your Bing Rewards region setting.
- **Pause/resume scheduler.** State changes fire `fireSchedulerWakeups()` immediately, but if a scheduler run is already in-flight when you Pause, the current run completes normally — pause takes effect at the NEXT scheduled wake. That's intentional (don't interrupt work in progress).
- **Node engine bump to `>=20.6.0`.** Docker users unaffected (image ships Node 22.23). Bare-metal users on Node 17/18/19 will see the fgc process fail to start until they upgrade Node or switch to Docker. Not a break for the primary supported path but worth flagging.

### Panel gains a Notifications journal (opt-out is deletion of `data/notifications-log.json`)

The Alerts tab now has a **Notifications sent** section: every apprise push fgc fires — real-time notifications, digest-buffered summaries, and delivery errors — appends to `data/notifications-log.json` and renders in the panel. Rolling cap of 500 entries. Filter by service / kind / status / text; expand rows to see the full body with clickable URLs. Rows within the last 24h are always visible; older ones sit behind a "Show more" button. This is the audit trail that was missing — no more "did that push actually fire?" mystery.

## What's new in 2.10.1

**Fix: panel's local `stripGpTail` override was masking the shared multi-word fix — silent daily-notify loop on "Ignored" `(Steam) Key Giveaway` entries.**

`src/util.js`'s `stripGpTail` was hardened for multi-word GamerPower title tails back in v2.8.75 (see [memory note](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#whats-new-in-2875)) — the regex became `\s*\([^)]+\)\s*(?:\w+\s+)*Giveaways?\b.*$` to cover `(Steam) Key Giveaway`, `(Epic Games) Beta Giveaway`, plural `Giveaways`, etc.

But `interactive-login.js:8874` had shadowed that helper with a local single-word copy (`Giveaway\b`) that never got updated. Consequence: when a user hit **Ignore** in the Discoveries tab on a title like `Dwarven Realms (Steam) Key Giveaway`, the panel wrote the dedup key `steam::dwarven realms steam key giveaway` — cruft included. Every subsequent Steam run's `getDiscoveryUserMarkedKeys()` lookup used the shared (fixed) `stripGpTail`, produced `steam::dwarven realms`, missed the stored key, and re-fired the "action needed" notify.

If your `steam_min_price` gate also happened to not exclude the item (because it wasn't set, or the item was above your threshold), the same notify shipped every single day forever. Caught locally on `Dwarven Realms (Steam) Key Giveaway` — one daily push for a full week.

Fix: dropped the local override and imported the shared `stripGpTail` from `src/util.js`. Any pre-2.10.1 stale keys in `data/discoveries-state.json` need one-time cleanup — either re-click Ignore in the panel (which now writes the correct key), or `jq` the JSON to drop keys where the value ends in ` giveaway`/` giveaways`.

Filed as another instance of the ["Sweep both code paths on locator fixes"](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) pattern — the panel and the runtime read/write the same on-disk data, so a helper that lives in both places must stay in sync. The right shape is to always import from `src/util.js`; a local shadow is a landmine.

## What's new in 2.10.0

**Shared `gotoWithRetry` across all sites ([PR #138](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/pull/138) by @mateusfn98) — organically covers @zhaoxp-xyz's [#137](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/137).**

The Epic-only `gotoWithNavRetry` helper (shipped for #104 / #105 back in v2.8.57-58 and extended for #107's `Target crashed`) is now generalised into `src/browser.js` as `gotoWithRetry(page, url, policy)`. Every site's top-level navigations use it, each with its own policy object (`attempts`, `backoffMs`, `isRecoverable`, `gotoOpts`, `siteId`).

- **Epic** — behaviour preserved exactly: 30s backoff × 2 attempts, `isRecoverableEpicPageError` predicate (still includes `Target crashed` + the ERR_* family).
- **Microsoft** — 5s × 2 with the existing `isRecoverableMsNavError` predicate, wraps both `BING_REWARDS_URL` gotos in the login flow.
- **FAB, GOG, Steam, Humble, Fanatical, Lenovo** — new defensive 5s × 2, retry-any policy where these sites previously had no retry at all.
- **Prime** — 4×30s with no backoff, tuned for Amazon Luna's intermittent tarpitting behaviour (per-attempt timeout 30s instead of the default 60s so a stalled document fails fast and re-navigates).

The Steam addition is what @zhaoxp-xyz's [#137](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/137) needed: a single `page.goto: net::ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE at https://store.steampowered.com/` at run-start no longer takes down the whole Steam pass — the retry gives Steam a second chance and the run continues if the second one lands.

Site versions bumped: epic-games 2.1→2.2, fab 0.1→0.2, fanatical 0.1→0.2, gog 2.2→2.3, humble-bundle 0.1→0.2, lenovo-gaming 0.1→0.2, microsoft 2.1→2.2, prime-gaming 2.0→2.1, steam 2.0→2.1.

Net +55 lines across 11 files (a lot of that is the helper's docs + per-site policy objects; the actual copy-paste it replaces was more compact than #136's launchContext preamble was). Second consecutive PR from @mateusfn98 — thanks for the follow-through.

## What's new in 2.9.4

**MS Rewards: new-UI card-click failures now save a diagnostic bundle — @dabziuebu4egh2's [#135](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/135).**

The old-UI activity-card function has always dumped a full-page screenshot + page HTML to `data/diagnostics/microsoft/ms-card-fail-*.{png,html}` on first failure. The new-UI equivalent (`clickNewUiActivityCards`) didn't — so when the redesigned dashboard's card clicks silently timed out, the only signal was the log line "Card #N click failed: elementHandle.click: Timeout 10000ms exceeded" with no way to see what was actually on screen.

Now the new-UI path dumps the same bundle plus the failing card's `outerHTML` and `boundingBox`, in `data/diagnostics/microsoft/ms-newui-{dailyset,exploreonbing}-fail-*.{png,html,meta.txt}`. Fires once per run on the first failure — enough to diagnose the account-variant DOM without spamming.

No behaviour change on successful runs.

---

## What's new in 2.9.3

**Internal refactor — extract shared `launchContext` factory ([PR #136](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/pull/136) by @mateusfn98).**

Every scraper (`aliexpress`, `epic-games`, `fab`, `fanatical`, `gog`, `humble-bundle`, `lenovo-gaming`, `microsoft`, `prime-gaming`, `steam`) plus the panel's browser-launch paths used to repeat the same `chromium.launchPersistentContext(...)` preamble verbatim — same `cleanProfileLocks + headless/viewport/locale/timezone/args/SIGINT` wiring, differing only in per-site overrides. That copy-paste is now centralised in `src/browser.js` as `launchContext(siteId, opts)`; per-site differences (extra GPU args, custom profile dir, fingerprint/device overrides, recording) flow in through options. Net **-128 lines** across 12 files.

Behaviour-preserving by design — no user-visible change. The `v2.9.0` locale/timezone rollout ended up touching every one of these launch sites individually; going forward, the same category of change is one line in one file. Also removes the "remembered to change 9 out of 10 places" bug class.

Thanks @mateusfn98 for the follow-through — clean, self-contained, exactly the shape I asked for.

---

## What's new in 2.9.2

**Restore `@types/node` devDep — my miscall in the v2.9.0 cleanup, caught by @mateusfn98 in [discussion #132](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/discussions/132).**

I removed `@types/node` in v2.9.0 after grepping for runtime imports and finding none — labelled it "unused" and dropped it. But `jsconfig.json` has `checkJs: true`, meaning every editor with the TypeScript language server (VS Code, Cursor, Zed, coc-tsserver) was silently leaning on `@types/node` for typings on `process.env`, `fs.readFileSync`, `path.resolve`, and the rest of Node's built-ins. Removing it broke type-check in-editor for every contributor — a silent editor-side regression with no CI signal, no test signal, no user-visible bug, but a real degradation of the code-quality signal the repo depends on.

Restored at the same version range (`^26.1.1`) it was at before removal. No runtime effect.

Lesson filed in local feedback memory: when triaging "unused" devDeps for removal, `grep`ing for runtime imports is necessary but not sufficient — must also check `jsconfig.json` / `tsconfig.json` for `checkJs`, `allowJs`, `types`, and `typeRoots`. `@types/*` packages are usually there for the editor, not the runtime.

Thanks @mateusfn98.

## What's new in 2.9.1

**FAB checkout diagnostic + selector broadening — ypurpl's [#127](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/127).**

ypurpl reported FAB failing on all Buy-now assets while manual claims through the browser worked fine. The three failure screenshots they attached all showed the clean product listing page rather than the actual failed-checkout state — because the existing catch block re-navigated to the product URL before capturing the screenshot, overwriting whatever the checkout flow had rendered. This release fixes the diagnostic path and takes a first pass at broadening the checkout-CTA selectors that were shipped without live-verification (the original test account already owned every free asset).

**Changes to `fab.js`:**

1. **Pre-fallback failure screenshot.** When the "saved in my library" wait times out, capture the live state (fullPage) *before* the fallback `page.goto(url)` overwrites it. Written to `data/screenshots/fab/failed/<id>_checkout_<timestamp>.png`. Also logs `page.url()` at the failure point when `DEBUG=1`.
2. **Broadened place-order selector coverage.** The prior selector list was scoped to `[role="dialog"]`, assuming a modal checkout. FAB may render checkout as a full-page navigation instead. The new candidate list races 10 alternatives (role-based + text-based) for up to 15s: `Place Order`, `Complete Order`/`Complete Purchase`, `Confirm`, `Get It Now`/`Get for free`, `Checkout`/`Proceed to Checkout`, plus the original dialog-scoped Buy Now fallback.
3. **DEBUG log which selector matched.** On success, prints `place-order CTA matched: <label>` so the next iteration can prune to the actual label FAB uses in production; on no-match, prints the current URL to help figure out where the flow went.
4. **Wider EULA/terms checkbox coverage.** Added an unchecked-form-checkbox fallback (`form input[type="checkbox"]:not(:checked)`) alongside the existing modal/name-matching patterns.
5. **Initial post-BuyNow wait: 2.5s → 4s.** FAB's checkout page renders through client-side routing; the extra window reduces spurious "no candidate matched" outcomes on slower connections.

If you're seeing FAB Buy-now failures, please update to `:2.9.1` and share the new `data/screenshots/fab/failed/<id>_checkout_*.png` — that screenshot will now show what the checkout page actually looked like at the moment of failure, and `DEBUG=1` output will name the button label FAB is currently using.

---

## What's new in 2.9.0

**Two independent changes merged together from @mateusfn98's [#125](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/pull/125) — one design change, one bug fix. Both opt-in for existing behavior; `en-US`-locale users see zero difference.**

### 1) Per-service locale, timezone & browser args for fingerprint coherence

Previously every browser context launched with hard-coded `locale: 'en-US'` and no `timezoneId`. On a non-US IP that mismatch reads as a proxy/bot signal — the PR author reported their Steam sessions were being flagged. Aligning the context locale with the environment fixed the detection.

**New behavior with `LANG` set** (e.g. `LANG=de_DE.UTF-8`):
- Browser context `locale` = derived BCP-47 tag (`de-DE`)
- `--lang` / `--accept-lang` flags match, with an English fallback appended (`de-DE,de;q=0.9,en;q=0.8`)
- Diagnostic error context also captures the locale for support triage

**New behavior with `TZ` set** (e.g. `TZ=Europe/Warsaw`):
- Browser context `timezoneId` = TZ value
- Aligns `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone` with your IP's geolocation

**`siteLocale()` per-site policy** (new helper in `src/util.js`):
- **Follows LANG:** Steam, GOG, Epic Games, Fanatical, Humble Bundle, Lenovo Gaming
  - All either force English via URL param (`?l=english` for Steam, `/en` for GOG, `/en-US` for Epic, `/en/` for Fanatical) or scrape locale-invariant APIs (Humble's `/store/api/search` JSON, Lenovo's URL-path selectors)
- **Stays pinned to `en-US`:** Prime Gaming, Microsoft Rewards (desktop + mobile), FAB, AliExpress
  - Locators on these sites key off English DOM text with no reliable URL-level English forcing; forcing English at the context level is required for them to keep working

**Per-service base-URL overrides** (all optional, `<SVC>_PAGE_URL` env vars):
- `EG_PAGE_URL`, `GOG_PAGE_URL`, `STEAM_PAGE_URL`, `FAB_PAGE_URL`, `HUMBLE_PAGE_URL`, `FANATICAL_PAGE_URL`, `LENOVO_PAGE_URL`, `UBISOFT_PAGE_URL`, `AE_PAGE_URL`
- Escape hatch for locale/regional redirects or for pinning to a different URL entry point
- All now surface in the panel's **Environment tab** under a new "Per-service URL overrides" category

**Additional fixes bundled in this change:**
- `interactive-login.js` GOG redeem URL now uses `/en/redeem/...` so the success heading stays English regardless of context locale
- `interactive-login.js` Steam redeem URL now includes `?l=english` for the same reason
- `localeArgs('en-US')` output matches the previous flag set byte-for-byte, so users who don't set `LANG` see zero behavior change

### 2) Steam login form selector bug fixes

Bundled with the locale change but independent — fixes a latent bug where the Steam login form's username input could be matched by the store header's search box when React class selectors went stale, silently sending emails into store search and looping login forever.

- **Username input** now scoped to `form:has(input[type="password"]) input[type="text"]:not([name="term"])` — excludes the search box
- **Sign-in button** now matched by text (`button:has-text("Sign in")`) instead of `button[type="submit"]` — the store header renders submit-typed buttons before the login form
- **2FA input + button** similarly scoped
- **New**: bad-credential detection surfaces `Steam rejected the login — check STEAM_EMAIL (use your Steam account name, not your email address) and STEAM_PASSWORD` + Pushover/Apprise notify + exit 1, instead of silently re-looping. Steam signs in with the account NAME, not the email — a common source of the previous loop.

### Follow-up cleanup in this release

- Removed unused `@types/node` devDep introduced in the PR (editor-only, nothing in the tree references it)
- Added a comment marker on the backgrounded credential-error handler so future readers don't remove the missing `await` thinking it's a bug
- Surfaced the new `<SVC>_PAGE_URL` env vars in the panel's Environment tab

**Full credit to @mateusfn98** for the design, implementation, and self-testing. Reviewed and merged into `main`.

## What's new in 2.8.83

**Docker images now publish semver-versioned tags.** Per @svartis's [#124](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/124): the workflow previously only tagged `:latest`, branch name, sha, and `YYYYMMDD` date. Kubernetes-style deploy tools (Flux CD, Watchtower, Renovate) need an explicit version tag to detect and roll to a specific release.

Added three semver-derived tags on git-tag push (`vX.Y.Z`):

- `ghcr.io/feldorn/free-games-claimer:2.8.83` — pin to exact release
- `ghcr.io/feldorn/free-games-claimer:2.8` — auto-follow patch releases within a minor
- `ghcr.io/feldorn/free-games-claimer:2` — auto-follow minor releases within a major

`:latest`, branch, sha, and `YYYYMMDD` tags continue to publish on branch pushes exactly as before — this is additive, no existing pin targets change.

To use with Flux CD, point your `ImageRepository` at `ghcr.io/feldorn/free-games-claimer` and set an `ImagePolicy` with `semver.range: '>=2.8.0 <3.0.0'` (or whatever range fits your update cadence).

Only affects the CI workflow — no runtime behavior change. Existing `:latest` deployments unaffected.

---

## What's new in 2.8.82

**Hotfix for 2.8.81 crash-loop.** Per @Zerofire03's [#123](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/123) (also confirmed by @Steggl and @dennis18816): the container exited immediately on startup with `SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier 'fullscreen'` at `interactive-login.js:7672`. Root cause: the 2.8.81 change added a code comment inside `showVnc()` that contained literal backticks around the words `fullscreen` and `clipboard-read; clipboard-write`. Because `showVnc()` lives inside the giant `PANEL_HTML` template literal (client-side JS embedded in the HTML string), those backticks silently terminated the outer template and broke the parse.

**Fix:** removed the comment; the one-line `iframe.allow` assignment is self-documenting. Same trap as v2.8.60 (@HelpMePleasepls's [#109](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/109)) — mental note added to the internal guidelines.

Pull `ghcr.io/feldorn/free-games-claimer:latest` (or `:2.8.82`) once GHCR finishes the build; the panel + claim runs will start cleanly again.

---

## What's new in 2.8.81

**Panel noVNC iframe: fullscreen + clipboard sync now work.** Merges @50P15's [#122](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/pull/122) (add `allow="fullscreen"` to the dynamically-created `<iframe>` in `showVnc()`) and broadens the `allow` list to also include `clipboard-read; clipboard-write` — noVNC's copy/paste bridge fails with the same "Disallowed by permissions policy" error for the same reason, so the fix generalizes cleanly.

Before: clicking the fullscreen button inside the "Show browser" panel view hit `TypeError: Disallowed by permissions policy` (Chrome/Brave) or `Fullscreen request denied` (Firefox). noVNC's clipboard sync silently failed on the same permissions-policy check.

After: `iframe.allow = 'fullscreen; clipboard-read; clipboard-write'` on the iframe element. Both features work as expected. No config changes needed on existing deploys — the panel just starts respecting the noVNC UI's fullscreen/clipboard buttons.

Only affects the dynamically-created iframe in `showVnc()`. No other iframes in the codebase need the attribute (verified via grep).

Credit: @50P15 for the diagnosis + original 1-line fix.

## What's new in 2.8.80

**Run Prime Gaming before GOG so cross-store keys redeem same-day.** Per @amphoterism's [#121](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/121): the pre-existing claim-order put GOG first (`claimOrder: 1`), Prime Gaming second. Prime routinely produces free-game keys that need to be redeemed on GOG's site (`redeem.gog.com`) — but since GOG's script had already finished for the day, Prime→GOG codes got queued for the NEXT scheduled GOG run. On weekly schedules this could stall a claim by up to 7 days.

**Fix:** in `src/sites.js`, changed GOG's `claimOrder` from `1` to `2.5` (between Prime Gaming's `2` and Epic Games' `3`). GOG now runs after Prime, so Prime→GOG key redemptions land on the same run. Cross-checked no other Prime-produced storefront is stalled by the change:

- Prime→Epic keys — Epic still runs after Prime (order 3 vs 2). Unchanged.
- Prime→Legacy Games — separate site, no dedicated script, unaffected.
- Prime→Microsoft Store / Xbox / Origin — no auto-redemption automation exists; these already surface as "pending manual redeem" in the Alerts tab.

**New order** (script-having services only): `prime-gaming(2) → gog(2.5) → epic-games(3) → fab(3.5) → steam(4) → ubisoft(6) → humble-bundle(7) → fanatical(8) → microsoft(9) → lenovo-gaming(10)`.

Rationale updated in the `getClaimScriptOrder()` header comment. No configurable-order option added yet — the hardcoded swap covers the reported case. If users hit a scenario the swap doesn't handle, a config knob is a follow-up.

Verified live via `/api/run-all` with a Prime+GOG+Epic+Steam site list: sections appeared in the expected order (Prime Gaming → GOG → Epic Games → Steam).

## What's new in 2.8.79

**Steam: suppress GamerPower Key-Giveaway notifications for games you already own.** Per @xh43k's [#119](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/119) follow-up: they were still getting daily Pushover pings for Dwarven Realms (a third-party Alienware Arena Steam-key giveaway routed through GamerPower) despite owning the game already.

**Root cause:** GamerPower `Key Giveaway` URLs don't resolve to a Steam `/app/<id>/` (they redirect to Alienware Arena or similar third-party pages), so `steam.js` had no appId to check ownership against — it fell through to a `notify_games` action push every run.

**Fix — two-tier ownership check in the GamerPower non-`/app/` branch:**

1. **Tier A (title-match against Steam claim DB).** Before firing the notify, walks `db.data[user]` looking for any row with status `claimed`/`existed` whose normalized title matches the GamerPower entry's stripped title. If found → suppress + log `already claimed per Steam DB (title match)`. Handles games we've claimed through the tool previously.
2. **Tier B (Steam-search + store-page ownership check).** For titles matching `/Key Giveaway/i`, calls Steam's public `storesearch` JSON API by title, finds the exact-match appId, visits the store page, checks `.game_area_already_owned`. Owned → persist `db.data[user][appId] = { status: 'existed', ... }` (Tier A will now catch on subsequent runs — no repeated search) + suppress notify with log `already in your Steam library (via title search)`. **Handles games owned via ANY source** — direct Steam purchase, Alienware Arena redemption, humble bundle, etc.

Cost: 1 `storesearch` HTTP + 1 store-page HTTP per Key-Giveaway per run, ONLY on the first-ever encounter of that title (subsequent runs hit the Tier A DB fastpath silently). Search + ownership check are wrapped in try/catch — any failure falls through to the existing notify path, so no items get silently dropped on network transients.

**Also fixes a stripGpTail regex bug** in `src/util.js`: `stripGpTail` only handled `"(Storefront) Giveaway"` shape, not the multi-word variants GamerPower uses (`"(Steam) Key Giveaway"`, `"(Epic Games) Beta Giveaway"`, plural `"Giveaways"`). Regex updated to accept an optional `\w+\s+` prefix on `Giveaway` — smoke-tested against all 6 known variants. This regex is shared with the Discoveries-tab title index, so its correctness improves title-based deduplication across the whole tool.

**Suppress the diagnostic banner for likely-transient errors; auto-dismiss on next successful run.** Reduces the "please don't file this" ceremony where users share Count:1 errors that had adjacent successful runs (e.g. rex099's [#120](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/120), a one-off Epic `egs-navigation` timeout on v2.8.76).

**Heuristic** (applied at record-time): a fresh fingerprint (`count === 1`) on a service that has ANY prior successful run in `data/last-runs.json` is auto-tagged `transientLikely: true`. Two things happen:

- **Banner suppressed.** The diagnostic banner state builder in `getState()` now skips `transientLikely` entries when picking "latest pending." User isn't nagged.
- **Errors tab still shows the entry** — with a "watching" pill styled quietly — so users retain full visibility. Fingerprint is logged, context captured, everything's there for triage if they want to look.

**Two ways an entry leaves the transient tier:**

- **Recurrence** — a second occurrence increments `count`, `_recordDiagnosticError` clears `transientLikely`, and the banner surfaces on next `getState()`.
- **Auto-dismiss on success** — `recordLastRunSuccess()` sweeps all `transientLikely=true` entries whose `script` matches the succeeded service (skipping ones the user has already decided). Logs `Diagnostics: auto-dismissed N transient-likely error(s) after <service> success.`.

Genuine bugs still hit the banner immediately on their second occurrence; genuine transients silently disappear on next success. Full round-trip verified end-to-end via test-injected diagnostic entries: `/api/state` banner-pending correctly excluded the transient, `/api/diagnostics/list` exposed the flag, a real Epic panel-run triggered the auto-sweep + log line.

**Existing entries** (pre-upgrade): don't have the `transientLikely` field, so they render/behave as before — no migration needed. The heuristic only kicks in on new fingerprints.

## What's new in 2.8.77

**Steam: detect DLC-without-base-game and skip persistently.** Per @xh43k's [#119](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/119) — daily Pushover spam for a DLC (The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu — Lost Explorers' Swords Pack, appId 4630450) that Steam refuses to claim because the base game isn't in the user's library.

Root cause: `steam.js` treated the failed-claim as a generic `failed` DB status, and the DB fastpath only skipped `claimed`/`existed` — so every next run retried the same doomed claim + generated another `failed` notification.

Fix:
- **`getGameDetails`** now inspects `.game_area_dlc_bubble` on the store page and extracts the base-game `appId` from the linked href — populates `details.isDlc` and `details.baseAppId`.
- **Claim loop** — when `isDlc && baseAppId` and the base game's status isn't `claimed` or `existed` in the local Steam DB, skip the claim attempt entirely and mark `status: 'skipped:requires-base-game'` on the DB row. One log line: `✗ <DLC title> — DLC — base game <N> not in your library, Steam refuses claim (persistent skip; if you later acquire the base game, clear its steam.json entry to re-eval)`.
- **DB fastpath** extended to treat `skipped:requires-base-game` as terminal — subsequent runs short-circuit via a new aggregate line: `• N DLC skipped — base game not in library (set DEBUG=1 to list)`. Zero HTTP roundtrip, zero notification push.
- **Recovery path**: if the user later acquires the base game (via Steam directly or via us), they can clear the DLC row from `data/steam.json` and the next run will re-evaluate the DLC normally.

Applies to all Steam DLC picked up by `/search?specials=1&maxprice=free` — historically these have been rare (Steam usually doesn't discount DLC to zero without the base game being free too), but when they do surface, they used to spam.

## What's new in 2.8.76

**Silence three repeat-every-run discovery log lines.** User report 2026-07-20: even after prior cleanups, these three lines still fired every run for the same reasons and cluttered the log without being actionable:

- `GamerPower (Steam): N entry/entries` — infra breadcrumb; user isn't going to act on "N entries returned"
- `! GamerPower → <title>: not a /app/ URL — listing as manual action (…)` — Discoveries tab already surfaces these with a MANUAL badge (v2.8.74's forecast); the per-item Pushover notify via `notify_games` still fires when worth ≥ min_price. Log line was redundant with those two authoritative surfaces.
- `! FreeGameFindings discovery skipped — Reddit API returned 403 ...` — datacenter/container IPs are hard-blocked by Reddit; nothing the user can act on. Multi-line boilerplate that fired every run.

All three now `console.debug`-gated — visible only with `DEBUG=1`. Applied consistently across `steam.js`, `epic-games.js`, and `gog.js` (same three-line pattern lives in each). Also dropped the equivalent `! FGF → <title>: not a /app/ URL` line in `steam.js`'s FGF path for the same reason.

Verified end-to-end via a Steam run — the block now flows tightly: `Steam header → Min rating/price → User → Promotions found → (aggregate + skip) → Summary`. No behavioral change to claiming, notifications, or Discoveries tab.

---

## What's new in 2.8.75

**Two Steam-run efficiency improvements** — user report 2026-07-19:

**1. Aggregate the "already owned — DB fastpath" log lines.** Previously the DB-fastpath emitted one `• <title> — already owned` log line per known-claimed game. On a mature library that surfaces every day, this added up to 5-10 identical-shape lines per run — pure noise once the fastpath is doing its job. Refactored to a pre-pass: partition `freeGames` into `ownedFromDb` (skip-and-count) and `gamesToProcess` (real work), then emit ONE aggregated line — `• N games already owned — skipped via claim DB (set DEBUG=1 to list)`. `DEBUG=1` still writes per-title `console.debug` entries for anyone who wants the detail.

**2. Skip GamerPower URL-resolve for games already in the queue.** The GamerPower discovery loop was calling `resolveGamerPowerHref()` (1-2s HTTP round-trip per entry) for every GP entry — including entries whose titles already matched a Steam-search-discovered game in `freeGames`. Now: pre-compute a `titleToAppId` index from `freeGames` before the loop; if the GP entry's title matches, skip the resolve entirely (silent — `DEBUG=1` logs the skip). Saves ~2-5 sec per Steam run on typical 2-3-entry GP/Steam-search overlaps.

Both changes are purely observational — no behavior change to claiming or the notification body. Just less log noise and less redundant network I/O.

## What's new in 2.8.74

**Two Steam-log clarity fixes.**

**1. Silence the "already in queue" dedupe log lines.** In the Steam run block, when GamerPower or FGF discovery found a game Steam's own `/search` endpoint had already picked up, we logged a per-item `✓ GamerPower → <title>: appId <id> already in queue` line. That's dev-facing plumbing — the user doesn't care that two discovery sources found the same game. Worse: when the dedupe line for one game interleaved with unrelated per-item lines from other GamerPower entries (e.g. a "manual action" line for a different item, or the recurring FGF 403 skip), users read them as related and thought the deduped game was failing / manual / erroring. Both the GamerPower and FGF dedupe lines are now `console.debug`-gated (visible only with `DEBUG=1`). The authoritative claim-time line (`• Sir Brante — already owned`) remains as the sole user-facing message for these games.

**2. Discoveries: forecast MANUAL for GamerPower "Key Giveaway" titles (Steam).** These are third-party key-distribution promos (Alienware Arena, IndieGala, dev landing pages, etc.) — their GamerPower `open_giveaway_url` never resolves to a Steam store `/app/<id>/`, so `steam.js` gives up at runtime and emits a manual-action notify. But the Discoveries tab was badging these as **AUTO** because its forecast only checked ownership + price. New `forecastManualKeyGiveaway()` heuristic downgrades AUTO → MANUAL when the title matches `/\bKey Giveaway\b/i`, with a clear label ("Steam key giveaway — the Steam collector can't redeem third-party keys. Open the GamerPower link to claim manually."). Reported 2026-07-19 via Dwarven Realms showing AUTO in Discoveries while the actual Steam run couldn't touch it. The runtime already handles this correctly — the fix is UI-only, aligning the tab with actual behaviour.

---

## What's new in 2.8.73

**Discoveries-tab price forecast now reads live `steam.minPrice`.** Related to v2.8.72: after a user dropped their Steam `min_price` from `10` → `8.99` in Settings to catch a $9.99 GamerPower giveaway, the Discoveries tab kept badging the entry SKIP against the OLD threshold — because the endpoint read `cfg.steam_min_price`, which is a **module-load-time snapshot** and doesn't refresh on Settings-UI edits without a panel restart. Same stale-cfg class of bug as the digest scheduler fix in v2.8.56.

Fix in `interactive-login.js`: the Discoveries `forecastSkip()` price threshold now sources from `describeConfig().effective.services.steam.minPrice`, which reflects Settings-UI edits immediately. Change threshold → next Discoveries fetch reflects it, no restart required.

The subprocess-side Steam collector (`steam.js`) is unaffected — each scheduled run spawns a fresh subprocess with a fresh `cfg` snapshot, so the actual claim path always reads the current value. Only the long-running panel process was holding stale cfg.

Diagnostic-body snapshots at `_captureErrorContext()` (interactive-login.js:658-660) still read `cfg.steam_*` — informational-only, not actionable; a separate polish item.

---

## What's new in 2.8.72

**Steam-side GamerPower fallback now honours `steam_min_price` before firing a manual-action notify.** Fixes a self-contradictory signal: for a Steam-key giveaway on GamerPower whose URL doesn't resolve to `/app/<id>/` (so `steam.js` can't auto-claim) AND whose advertised `worth` is below your `steam_min_price` threshold, the Discoveries tab correctly badges the entry SKIP (won't fire on next run) but the Steam-run notify still emitted a "manual action needed" line for the same item. Users got a push saying "act on this" while the UI told them to skip.

Fix in `steam.js`: the same `parsePrice(entry.worth)` check the Discoveries tab uses is now applied inline. If the worth parses to a value below `cfg.steam_min_price`, the manual-action notify is silently dropped and a run-log `log.info` line records the skip for traceability. Non-parseable worth ("N/A", missing field) falls through to the existing action path — user should still evaluate manually.

Discovered via a Dwarven Realms ($9.99) run notify contradicting the Discoveries tab's SKIP badge on a `min_price=10` config.

## What's new in 2.8.71

**Settings-tab checkbox for the MS Rewards mobile session.** Follow-up to @xh43k's [#116](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/116): v2.8.69 wired the runtime to honour `services.microsoft-mobile.active` but there was no UI toggle to reach that config value — the microsoft-mobile service is rolled into the parent Microsoft Rewards row via `linkedWith`, so it wasn't rendered independently.

Fix: `getServiceRows()` now injects a synthetic **"Run mobile session"** checkbox at the top of the Microsoft Rewards row's fields, pointing at `services.microsoft-mobile.active`. Unchecking it skips the mobile session (including the 5–20 min inter-session wait, the mobile-UA browser context spawn, and the search loop) — same behaviour as `MS_MOBILE_ACTIVE=false` in env. Unchecking the parent Microsoft Rewards toggle above still disables both desktop + mobile via the existing linked-active cascade.

No runtime code change beyond the row synthesis — this is a UI-only fix on top of v2.8.69's runtime honour.

---

## What's new in 2.8.70

**In-panel GitHub reply alerts.** Closes the "diagnostic submitted, never heard back" loop. Users who click **Share to GitHub** in the Alerts tab rarely come back to GitHub to check for replies, so clarifying questions I post sit unread and issues stall on my side. Now the panel polls your issues daily and surfaces new reply activity as a dedicated Alerts-tab section — no more losing track.

**How it works (opt-in at first submit):**

1. Click Share to GitHub on any Alerts-tab error. If your `github.username` isn't set yet, a one-time modal appears: *"Enter your GitHub username and this panel will poll your issues once a day and surface new replies in the Alerts tab."* Save & continue → username saved, submit URL opens. Skip → username stays empty, feature stays silently disabled forever (no polling, no privacy footprint), submit URL still opens.
2. Once set, `src/github-watch.js` runs a lightweight daily loop that hits `search/issues?q=repo:feldorn/free-games-claimer+author:{username}` (anonymous REST — no token, no security surface) plus `issues/{n}/comments?since=` for each returned issue. New comments not authored by you are tallied per-issue and stored in `data/github-watch.json`.
3. **Alerts tab gets a new "GitHub replies" section.** Each issue with unread comments shows title, `open` / `closed` state badge, reply count, latest commenter, and a 240-char preview of the newest comment. **Mark read** button is local-only (updates the state file, doesn't touch GitHub).
4. Nothing about the feature engages if `github.username` is empty — no HTTP requests, no state file writes, section stays hidden.

**Anonymous polling caveats:** the GitHub REST anonymous rate limit is 60 requests/hour per IP. Daily cadence + a handful of watched issues per user keeps this comfortably under the limit. Public repos only (that's us).

**Env var + Settings:** `GH_USERNAME` in your compose environment, or Settings → Environment (read-only display; edit via the modal at first Share to lock in the value). Change requires a panel restart (like other env-only values).

**Files:** new `src/github-watch.js` (poll + state file); `src/app-config.js` new `github.username` schema field + `GH_USERNAME` in `ENV_DISPLAY`; `interactive-login.js` scheduler loop + `/api/alerts/summary` extended with `ghReplies` array + `/api/alerts/github-mark-read` endpoint + Alerts-tab render section + modal HTML/CSS + `openShareUrlWithGithubPrompt()` wrapper on both Share-to-GitHub call sites.

## What's new in 2.8.69

**MS Rewards mobile skip-before-wait + honour the mobile Active toggle.** Two fixes for @xh43k's [#116](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/116):

1. **`microsoft-mobile.active` in Settings → Services now actually disables the mobile session.** The toggle existed in the schema but `microsoft.js` didn't consult it — the mobile session ran regardless (only Sessions-tab visibility responded to the flag). Now `microsoft.js` reads `services.microsoft-mobile.active` via `describeConfig()` on startup and short-circuits the mobile session if it's false. Users who want mobile off entirely can uncheck it in Settings → Services → Microsoft Rewards (Mobile).
2. **Skip-decision moved before the 5–20 minute inter-session wait.** v2.8.68's new-UI skip fired inside the mobile block, which meant new-UI accounts still sat through the delay before doing nothing. Now both the wait AND the mobile session are gated on a single `skipMobileEntirely` check that runs before the delay — new-UI accounts (or accounts with the mobile toggle off) go straight from the desktop session to the end-of-run summary.

`skipMobileEntirely = !mobileActiveInConfig || sessionSawNewUi` — either condition triggers the same code path: log the reason, emit a `skipped=1` mobile summary, no wait, no browser context spawn.

## What's new in 2.8.68

**MS Rewards mobile pre-login skip + end-of-run summary isolation on new UI.** Fixes both problems @Dr4w reported in [#114](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/114):

**Problem 1 — mobile skip fired too late.** v2.8.66's `isNewMsUi(page)` check on the mobile session was inside `if (loggedIn)`. On new-UI accounts, `login(page)` throws before the check is reached — MS's mobile OAuth flow errors with `unauthorized_client: The client does not exist or is not enabled for consumers.` and the email-input `waitForSelector` inside `login()` times out. The skip never triggered.

**Problem 2 — mobile crash killed the end-of-run summary.** The mobile block had `try/finally` but no `catch`. The `unauthorized_client` throw propagated past the mobile block, past the summary block, and out of the process — so on new-UI accounts, users got NO notification at all: not the desktop successes, not the mobile failure, nothing.

Fixes in `microsoft.js`:

- **Module-level `sessionSawNewUi`** captured during the desktop session (right after `readPointsBalance`, `.catch(() => false)` for safety). Cheap, defaults to old-UI behaviour under any unexpected DOM.
- **Mobile pre-login skip** consults `sessionSawNewUi` at the very top of the mobile try, before any login attempt. If desktop confirmed new UI, mobile logs a clear "skipping mobile session pre-login" line and moves on — `login()` never runs, `unauthorized_client` never throws.
- **Belt-and-suspenders post-login mobile check** kept for setups where desktop is disabled (`microsoft` service inactive, `microsoft-mobile` active alone) and `sessionSawNewUi` never got set — if the mobile session manages to reach the dashboard on new UI, we still skip the earning walk.
- **Catch on both desktop and mobile session `try` blocks** — any exception is logged as `<Session> session failed: <message> — continuing to end-of-run summary` and the run continues. Summary block now fires unconditionally after both sessions, regardless of which one failed.

If MS reinstates mobile earning or fixes the OAuth `unauthorized_client` error, the skip disengages automatically the moment `isNewMsUi()` returns false (containers disappear).

---

## What's new in 2.8.67

**Apprise circuit-breaker on container-wide network transients.** Triggered by @lequan2909's [#113](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/113): during a DNS/network outage at the container level, every per-service failure tried to send its own apprise notification — which itself failed for the same reason — generating N+1 useless "apprise diag: exit 1" errors in the log for a single outage.

New behavior in `src/util.js`:

- Track a per-process streak of apprise-send failures matching the **network-transport family**: `Temporary failure in name resolution` / `Name or service not known` / `getaddrinfo` / `ENOTFOUND` / `EAI_AGAIN` / `ECONNREFUSED` / `ECONNRESET` / `ENETUNREACH`. Deliberately narrow — per-target rate limits (429), auth failures (401/403), and payload rejections are NOT matched and continue to surface each time as before (those are actionable).
- After 2 consecutive network-family failures, silence further `notify()` calls for the rest of this process lifetime with a single `apprise: silencing further notifications this run — 2 consecutive network-transport failures suggest container-wide outage. Will resume on next process start.` warning line.
- Any successful send resets the pre-threshold streak — an isolated network blip earlier in the run doesn't accumulate toward the trip when the network was otherwise fine.
- Cross-process state is intentionally not persisted — each spawned service subprocess (Epic, GOG, FAB, etc.) starts with a fresh counter. That's a small compromise for a rare transient class; a container-wide outage will still generate ~2 apprise errors per subprocess instead of ~2 per notify call.

No user-visible behavior change on healthy networks — you never hit the threshold, log looks identical.

## What's new in 2.8.66

**Auto-skip the MS Rewards mobile earning walk on new UI accounts** — per @Dr4w's [#110](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/110) follow-up (2026-07-08): "It runs fine but earns nothing on the new dashboard, so it's just a pointless browser session at this point."

The mobile session was still executing `clickEveryPendingActivityCard` + `claimPendingBonusPoints` + `claimReadyToClaimCard` + a full 25-search Bing loop against a mobile user-agent context, even though Microsoft removed the mobile-searches earning activity from the redesigned dashboard. The walk credited zero points and cost several minutes of wall-clock per run.

Now: after the mobile session's pre-check balance read, `isNewMsUi(page)` is consulted; if the redesigned dashboard is detected, the activity walk + search loop are skipped and the run reports `skipped=1, pointsEarned=0` (with the pre-check balance carried forward as the current-balance snapshot). Old-UI mobile accounts are unaffected — they run the full walk exactly as before.

**If MS reinstates mobile earning:** the detection is the same `#dailyset` / `#exploreonbing` container check the desktop path uses. When those containers disappear (MS rolls back), the skip branch auto-disengages and the walk resumes.

**If you want to disable the mobile session entirely:** uncheck `microsoft-mobile` under Settings → Services. The existing per-service Active toggle is untouched — this release only adds the auto-skip on top of it.

---

## What's new in 2.8.65

**Locale-portable filters + zero-guard on the MS Rewards new-UI path.** Follow-up to v2.8.63/64 based on @JLMael's post-verification review of [#110](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/110) — the core new-UI dispatch works (`attempted=6 clicked=6 errors=0` end-to-end on their account) but two bugs surfaced on French-locale sessions that also affect English:

1. **Completed-card filter was text-based** — `/\bCompleted\b/i` matched EN but missed FR "Terminé", so on FR sessions completed cards got **re-clicked** each run. That's exactly the shape MS's "unusual activity" gate keys off. Switched both `#dailyset` and `#exploreonbing` selectors to a structural check: `:not(:has(.bg-statusSuccessRewardsBg))` — the green success-chip class the redesign applies to completed cards regardless of language.
2. **`claimReadyToClaimCard` had no zero-guard** — when no points were pending, the SVG+text walk still matched the always-present arrow, clicked into an empty modal, and burned the full 10s `waitForSelector` timeout before failing over. It also silently no-op'd on FR sessions (matched on the literal "Claim" text, which reads "Réclamer" in French). Rewrote to key off `button:has(.bg-statusDangerBg)` — the red status dot appears **only** when there ARE claimable points, works portably across locales, and eliminates the spurious modal open. Modal CTA matcher now covers EN "Claim points" + FR "Réclamer les points" / "Réclamer".

Deferred JLMael's other observations to future releases:
- `#moreactivities` ("Continue earning") — third card container worth ~69 pts/day on their /earn page. Bigger click volume → plausibly stronger unusual-activity signal, so wants opt-in flag design.
- RSC-stream JSON `dailySetItems` for locale-proof completion detection — worthwhile architecture change, bigger scope.

## What's new in 2.8.64

**Hotfix for v2.8.63's `expandNewMsUiSection` selector regression.** Caught by @mzernetsch on [#110](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/110). Two issues in the previous release:

1. `#${containerId} button[aria-expanded="false"]` matched the section's **info** button (a small "ⓘ" icon that also has `aria-expanded="false"` because it toggles a modal). Clicking the info button opened a modal that then intercepted every subsequent card click — total regression on the new-UI activity-card path.
2. The section-toggle button's own `aria-expanded` state is buggy on MS's side — always false regardless of open/closed state. So even keying off `aria-expanded` on the correct element wouldn't have worked.

Fix (per @mzernetsch's suggestion): key off the SVG chevron's `.rotate-180` class instead — present when the section is open (chevron up), absent when closed (chevron down). Target the toggle by its section-name aria-label:

- `[aria-label="Daily set"]:not(:has(.rotate-180))` — Daily set toggle when closed
- `[aria-label="Explore on Bing"]:not(:has(.rotate-180))` — Explore on Bing toggle when closed

Also confirmed by @mzernetsch: card clicks fire through even on collapsed sections (the anchor's `href` navigates regardless of visibility). So the expansion step is now a defensive UX-nicety rather than a functional prerequisite — even if the toggle selector misses, the card clicks still succeed.

## What's new in 2.8.63

**MS Rewards new-UI activity-card port (Dr4w's [#110](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/110) Bug 2).** Second-wave fix for the redesigned Rewards dashboard, using DOM samples from Dr4w + selector suggestions from mzernetsch and kevindevm on the issue thread.

The redesigned dashboard is a Tailwind-CSS rewrite of the old AngularJS shell — none of the `mee-card` / `mee-rewards-daily-set-item-content` selectors match anymore, and the activity cards were split across two pages instead of one. Since my own account is still on the pre-redesign UI (probed 2026-07-03), the port relies on the community-provided DOM samples:

- **New helper `isNewMsUi(page)`** — detects the redesign via presence of `#dailyset` or `#exploreonbing` container IDs.
- **New helper `expandNewMsUiSection(page, containerId)`** — clicks the collapsible section's `aria-expanded="false"` toggle so cards inside become actionable. Best-effort: no-op if already open or toggle shape differs. Addresses the "cards found but click times out at 15s" signature in Dr4w's diagnostic.
- **New helper `clickNewUiActivityCards(page)`** — walks both pages: `#dailyset` on `/dashboard` (mzernetsch's `#dailyset a:not([href$="/earn"])` selector, filters out the "See more → /earn" link) and `#exploreonbing` on `/earn` (mzernetsch's `#exploreonbing a:not(:has(.grayscale))` selector, skips locked/grayscale cards; also catches "Keep earning" bonuses per mzernetsch's follow-up). Cards whose visible text includes `"Completed"` are skipped without click attempts. Popup-interception retry follows the same shape as the old-UI path.
- **Dispatch in `clickEveryPendingActivityCard`** — if `isNewMsUi(page)` returns true, use the new-UI path; otherwise the legacy `mee-card` code stays intact. Both UIs coexist during the rollout.

**Bug 3 (mobile searches):** Dr4w confirmed the mobile-searches activity card is entirely removed from the redesigned dashboard. Not fixable on our side — Microsoft made a product decision. The new-UI dispatch above already handles mobile-view accounts gracefully: if `#dailyset`/`#exploreonbing` aren't present on mobile, the flow falls through to zero-card completion; if they are, it walks them the same way. The base-point Bing search loop itself is unchanged and still fires — whether Microsoft credits those searches is up to them.

**What's still open:** mzernetsch's "Edge Browsing Streak" observation (new activity requiring Edge browser to complete) — I've filed it as a separate track. Making patchright present as Edge is a bigger investigation (user-agent + client hints + fingerprint), not shipping in this release.

## What's new in 2.8.62

**Partial fix for the MS Rewards dashboard redesign (Dr4w's [#110](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/109)).** Targets **Bug 1 (readPointsBalance)**; Bug 2 (activity-card clicks) and Bug 3 (mobile searches) remain open pending the reporter's DOM dump for the new UI.

Context: MS is gradually rolling out a redesigned Rewards dashboard. My own account is still on the pre-redesign UI (probed 2026-07-03) so I can't reverse-engineer the new selectors locally, but three changes below help users on the new UI **without needing to see their DOM**:

1. **`/about` redirect handler.** When `page.goto(rewards.bing.com)` lands on `/about` (Dr4w's Bug 1 symptom — session appears logged-out to the scraper), the script now logs the redirect + explicitly navigates to `rewards.bing.com/dashboard` and re-waits. Old-UI accounts stay at `/` as before; new-UI accounts get their real dashboard.
2. **RSC-stream probe now tries both `/` and `/dashboard`.** The React Server Components fetch from kevindevm's #71 (v2.8.40) is data-layer, not DOM — it survives redesigns *if* we hit the right URL. Old UI serves the RSC blob at the root; the redesign moves it to `/dashboard`. Trying both covers both.
3. **Text-driven "Available points" fallback.** New locate-strategy: find the DOM node whose text is exactly `"Available points"` (the label text Microsoft kept identical between old and new UIs — confirmed via probe of my old-UI account + Dr4w's screenshot of the new UI), then walk up ≤6 ancestors looking for a numeric-only descendant. Portable across UIs, locale-limited to English at this point.

**Still broken on the new UI:**

- Pending-activity-card clicks time out (Bug 2) — needs the new UI's card DOM shape, which I don't have.
- Mobile search discovery (Bug 3) — needs confirmation whether MS removed it or moved it.

**Workaround if you're on the new UI and want to disable auto-runs entirely:** Settings → Services → Microsoft Rewards → uncheck Active, or `MS_SCHEDULE_HOURS=0` in your compose. The redemption tracker + balance history still work if you manually visit rewards.bing.com through the panel's **Show browser** view.

## What's new in 2.8.61

**Hotfix for v2.8.60.** The `toggleScheduleDay()` helper added in v2.8.60 for the day-of-week checkbox row had backticks around \`day\` in its docstring. That function lives inside the giant `PANEL_HTML` template literal (client-side JS is served as text inside the JS module's outer template string), so the backticks terminated the outer template and the whole `interactive-login.js` module failed to parse at startup. Container went into restart loop for anyone who pulled the v2.8.60 image.

Long-standing memory note about `PANEL_HTML` and inline backticks — regression prevention: git-diff-scan v2.8.60→v2.8.61 confirms this was the only backtick introduced in v2.8.60. Anyone who pulled v2.8.60 and got the restart loop should pull `:latest` (v2.8.61) — the panel will come back up on next start with no config changes required.

## What's new in 2.8.60

Two customer-driven changes shipped together.

### 1. Extend Epic recoverable-error family to `Target crashed` + guard the diagnostic-screenshot call

Per marlonqpa's [#107](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/107): on **arm64** with `TZ=Europe/Warsaw`, a claim of `I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream` failed, then the diagnostic-screenshot capture crashed the Chromium renderer with `page.screenshot: Target crashed` — a **different error class** than the `Target ... has been closed` family v2.8.57/58 shipped guards for. Renderer-process crashes (SIGSEGV / GPU crash / OOM) are especially common on arm64 where Chromium has fewer optimized paths. My guard didn't match, so a diagnostic-screenshot failure after an already-logged claim failure cascaded into failing the whole Epic run.

Changes to `epic-games.js`:

- Renamed `isRecoverableEpicNavError` → `isRecoverableEpicPageError` (the family covers non-navigation crashes now).
- **Added `Target crashed` to the recognized recoverable-family regex.**
- **Also fixed a latent bug in the regex:** the actual Playwright error string is `Target page, context or browser has been closed` (comma list) — my v2.8.57/58 regex `Target (page|context|browser) has been closed` never matched that shape. Guard was shipping non-functional. Regex now includes the comma-list form explicitly plus the single-target variants for future-proofing.
- Wrapped both `page.screenshot` call sites (the post-failure diagnostic capture at L665 and the per-game capture at L683) in try/catch that recognizes the recoverable-page-error family — a screenshot failure now logs a warn and moves on, never fails the run.

### 2. Day-of-week checkbox mask on the anchored scheduler

Per amphoterism's [#108](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/108): schedule by day of the week so a NAS reboot doesn't drift the schedule. Current anchored mode is time-only; adding a mask lets users say "Thursdays at 11:00" without resorting to external cron.

- New schema field `scheduler.dailyStartDays` (array of ints 0-6, `0 = Sunday`, `6 = Saturday`). Default `[0,1,2,3,4,5,6]` = all days = existing behavior.
- New env var **`START_DAYS`** (comma-separated: `START_DAYS=4` for Thursdays, `START_DAYS=1,3,5` for Mon/Wed/Fri). Surfaced in the Environment tab under a new "Scheduler" category.
- Validator rejects empty mask ("at least one day required") so a misclick can't silently disable the scheduler; also rejects out-of-range values, duplicates, and non-integers.
- `computeMainWakeMs()` extended: after computing the anchored candidate wake, if the day-of-week is not in the mask, advance one day at a time until it is. Capped at 7 iterations (a valid mask always contains at least one day). Only applied in anchored mode — interval-from-completion has no wall-clock day-of-week semantics.
- Settings UI: **7-checkbox row** in Scheduler settings, visible only when Start time is set. Sunday-first ordering matches JS `Date.getDay()`. Inline warning shown when all 7 unchecked; server rejects the save.
- Schedule tab surfaces the mask when it's not all-days (e.g. "Days · Claimers: Mon, Wed, Fri only") — silent on the default.
- Missed days do not queue backfill runs — matches the existing "past-target wakes mark as missed" architecture.
- **Applies to the main claim chain only.** MS Rewards day-of-week mask is deferred to a follow-up.

Docs: [Day-of-week filter](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#day-of-week-filter) section added.

## What's new in 2.8.59

**Environment tab surfaces `TZ` and `LANG` — with a note explaining what each affects.** Per eapzzz's [#106](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/106): "the app displays everything in UTC and has no timezone setting." The answer is the container's standard `TZ` env var (Node reads it at process start and it flows into log timestamps, scheduler input times, digest hour, wall-time labels), but that was tribal knowledge — nothing in the panel told users to set it.

Now the Environment tab has a new **Locale & timezone** category with:

- **TZ** — shows the current env value (or `unset`), with an inline note explaining what setting it does and pointing at IANA syntax (`TZ=Europe/Warsaw`). A user hitting the "why is everything in UTC" confusion can see the answer in the panel instead of needing to open an issue.
- **LANG** — same treatment for the Chromium locale env var (drives `--lang` / `Accept-Language` so storefronts render in the user's language, and is recorded in diagnostic error context).

Both are env-only (Node reads at process start), so the tab just shows their state — changing them requires editing your compose file and restarting the container.

---

## What's new in 2.8.58

**Extend the Epic `Target page closed` guard to the run-start navigations too.** fl-99's [#105](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/105) hit the same `page.goto: Target page, context or browser has been closed` error class as #104 — on **v2.8.57 (the fix I just shipped)** — but at a different stack point: the very first `page.goto(URL_CLAIM)` at run start, not the per-game loop I guarded. My earlier reasoning ("URL_CLAIM stays unguarded — 'can't start' is distinct from mid-run tear-down") was wrong; the same transient hits there too.

Changes:

- Hoisted `isRecoverableEpicNavError` from the per-game-loop scope to module scope so all three call sites can use it.
- Added a `gotoWithNavRetry(page, url, opts, label)` helper — try once, on recoverable-family failure log a warn + wait 30s + retry once. If the retry succeeds, log an info line. If the retry fails, throw so the outer catch surfaces the exception through the normal diagnostic-report path (retry is a chance to ride out a transient, not a way to mask persistent problems).
- Called at `URL_CLAIM` (L98) and `URL_LOGIN` (L112). Per-game gotos inside the claim loop deliberately still don't retry — one bad game shouldn't cost 30s against the rest of the batch, and the v2.8.57 per-game guard already breaks cleanly if the whole tab is gone.

If the transient resolves in the 30s window (network blip, Chromium settled, etc.), the Epic run continues normally with one warn line instead of a failed run + diagnostic-banner error. If it doesn't resolve, behavior is unchanged from v2.8.57 (diagnostic surfaces, exit 1).

---

## What's new in 2.8.57

**Defensive guard on the Epic per-game claim loop against Chromium tear-down.** JLMael's [#104](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/104) hit the exact `page.goto: Target page, context or browser has been closed` shape that `microsoft.js` got a guard for in v2.8.39 (via #67 / #80 / #100) — but on the Epic side, where a single bad goto took down the whole claim loop instead of degrading to one skipped game.

Same pattern applied to `epic-games.js` now:

1. `page.isClosed()` check before each per-game `page.goto` — if the tab is gone, break out of the loop cleanly. Remaining games get picked up on the next scheduled run.
2. `page.goto` wrapped in a try/catch that recognizes the "target closed" family plus the `ERR_ADDRESS_UNREACHABLE / ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED / ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED / ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED / ERR_CONNECTION_RESET / ERR_TIMED_OUT / interrupted by another navigation` transients. Recoverable failures log the URL that was in flight (so the next diagnostics submission tells us which game triggered the tear-down) and continue with the next game; genuine unexpected exceptions still rethrow to the outer handler.
3. If a recoverable failure leaves `page.isClosed()` true, the loop breaks instead of continuing (no goto after this will succeed anyway).

The retry loop for captcha-failed games (L627) already had a per-iteration try/catch, so it degrades correctly. The top-level `URL_CLAIM` / `URL_LOGIN` gotos at run start stay unguarded — if they fail we genuinely can't do anything (distinct from mid-run tear-down after discovery succeeded).

---

## What's new in 2.8.56

**Fix: digest scheduler now honors Settings-tab changes without a panel restart.** `computeDigestWakeMs()` and the post-wake guard in `digestSchedulerLoop()` were reading `cfg.notify_level` and `cfg.notify_digest_hour` — module-load snapshots that don't pick up in-app Settings edits. Switched to `describeConfig().effective.notifications.notifyLevel / .digestHour` (same live-read pattern the main + MS + Lenovo loops already use). Toggling verbosity or the digest hour from the panel now takes effect on the next scheduler wake instead of requiring a container restart.

No user-visible change under env-var-only configuration.

---

## What's new in 2.8.55

**New notification verbosity tier: `digest`.** For users with many active services who don't want a Pushover ping per claim run per service — buffers all per-run summaries into a single aggregated notification dispatched daily at a configurable local hour.

Third and final of the three planned integration adds (HA sensors landed in 2.8.53, Alerts tab in 2.8.54, this closes it).

**How to enable**

Settings → Notifications → Verbosity → **Digest**, or `NOTIFY_LEVEL=digest` in env. Second setting: **Digest hour** (env `NOTIFY_DIGEST_HOUR`, default `8`, valid 0-23) — the local hour when the aggregated notification fires each day.

**What it does**

- Per-run "N claimed, M already owned" summary notifications get **buffered to `data/notification-digest.json`** instead of dispatching immediately.
- Every day at the configured hour, the panel's new digest scheduler drains the buffer, builds one aggregated notification body (per-run entries, MS Rewards balance context, outstanding-Alerts hint), and dispatches via the normal apprise path.
- The buffer file is persisted so a mid-day container restart doesn't lose accumulated entries.
- **Action-required notifications still fire real-time**: captchas, stale-session warnings, apprise errors, watcher new-items, redeem reminders. The digest is a noise-reducer for the summary noise, not a delay-mechanism for anything that needs your attention now.
- The digest body includes a top-line "⚠ Outstanding: N pending Prime redeems · M pending Steam keys · K stale sessions — check the Alerts tab" hint (with a deep-link to the panel if `PUBLIC_URL` is set) so items pooling in the Alerts tab don't get missed by users on digest mode.

**Implementation notes**

- `src/util.js` — `notify()` gate now branches on `level === 'digest' && kind === 'summary'` → append to buffer; all other paths unchanged.
- `src/util.js` exports `readDigestBuffer()` and `markDigestFlushed()` for the scheduler.
- `interactive-login.js` — new `digestSchedulerLoop()` runs alongside the main + MS + Lenovo loops. Wakes at the next occurrence of the configured hour, flushes the buffer, sleeps to the next occurrence. Reacts to config changes via `sleepUntilWakeup(sleepMs)`'s reload signal, same pattern as the other schedulers.
- Buffer capped at 500 entries to guard against pathological notification storms (e.g. every-minute LOOP producing thousands of summaries between flushes). Drops oldest first.
- `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` updated with the new level in the verbosity table plus a section on digest specifics.

Existing deploys see no behavior change — `all` remains the default.

---

## What's new in 2.8.54

**Diagnostics tab → Alerts tab.** Same tab slot in the panel, expanded scope: pending code redemptions, stale sessions, and unread Discoveries items now surface alongside the existing error-report flow. Direct answer to timothe's #101 ("I can't tell what the codes are and can't clear them") and the general observation that the panel had no single place to see "everything that needs my attention right now."

Four sections, each hiding itself when empty (a healthy run leaves the tab visibly blank except for the header):

- **Pending redeems** — Prime Gaming manual redemptions (MS Store / Xbox / GOG codes) plus Steam keys collected from any service DB. Each row shows title, source, redeem URL, and the code as a monospace `user-select: all` copy target. Two action buttons: **Mark redeemed** (sets `status: 'redeemed'` on the DB entry — use after entering the code externally) and **Dismiss** (sets `status: 'dismissed'` — for expired offers or codes you've decided not to redeem). Either terminal status stops the pending-redeem notification loop from surfacing the entry on future runs.
- **Stale sessions** — active services whose latest session check reports `not_logged_in`. Each row has a **Log in** button deep-linking to the Sessions tab's login flow for that service. Uses cached status — for a fresh probe, use the Sessions-tab Check button.
- **New in Discoveries** — count-only pointer to unread aggregator items. **Go check** switches to the Discoveries tab.
- **Errors** — the existing diagnostics banner flow, unchanged. Same table, same Share / Don't Share / Never Share buttons per fingerprint, same GitHub-issue pre-fill.

New server endpoints:

- `GET /api/alerts/summary` — one-shot fetch for the top three sections (Errors keeps its existing `/api/diagnostics/list`)
- `POST /api/alerts/redeem-action` — `{ source, dbFile?, user, title, action }` writes `status: 'redeemed' | 'dismissed'` + `actionedAt` timestamp to the underlying DB entry. Auth-gated (same as other write endpoints).

Internal tab id stayed as `diagnostics` for backwards compat — URL deep-links like `?focus=diagnostics` and existing `switchTab('diagnostics')` calls continue to work, they just land on a bigger tab. Users bookmarked to the Diagnostics tab see it renamed to Alerts with the errors table still present at the bottom.

Second of three planned integration adds. HA sensors shipped in v2.8.53; notification digest mode is queued next.

---

## What's new in 2.8.53

**New endpoint `/api/hass/sensors` for Home Assistant integration.** Returns a flat JSON snapshot of the values HA users typically surface on their dashboards — MS Rewards balance, weekly / monthly / all-time claim counts, pending redeems (Prime + Steam), stale sessions, last-claim, last-run status, captcha-pending, and a per-service breakdown. HA users configure a single stock REST sensor pointing at this URL and derive template sensors for each field. No add-on or custom component needed.

Intentionally unauthenticated (same policy as `/api/health`) so HA's REST integration works out of the box. Data exposed matches what's already visible on the Stats + Sessions tabs — nothing sensitive. Users with publicly-reachable panels who want it locked down anyway can put a reverse proxy with basic auth or an IP allowlist in front.

New [`docs/HOMEASSISTANT.md`](docs/HOMEASSISTANT.md) walks through the setup with copy-paste-ready YAML for:

- The primary REST sensor + `json_attributes` block
- Template sensors for balance, claim counts, last-claim, pending-redeems, stale-sessions
- Binary sensors for captcha-pending, last-run-success, and a combined "has alerts" indicator
- Automations for captcha alerts, session-expiry notifications, and weekly claim summaries

First of three planned integration additions — Alerts tab and notification digest mode are queued next.

## What's new in 2.8.52

**Two fixes reported today, both small.**

### Prime Gaming pending-redeem notification now includes the code ([#101](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/101))

Reported by timothe: recurring daily Telegram pings saying `- DOOM Eternal → https://account.microsoft.com/billing/redeem` and `- Fallout 76 (PC) → https://account.microsoft.com/billing/redeem` — same two games every day, no way to figure out what the actual redemption codes were. The MS Store / Xbox redeem URL is generic (no code prefill in the URL like GOG has), so the notification pointed at *where* to redeem but not *what* to enter. The codes were sitting in `data/prime-gaming.json` all along.

Notification body now includes the code inline when present:

> `- DOOM Eternal → https://account.microsoft.com/billing/redeem (code: ABCD-1234)`

For GOG (whose URL already embeds the code) the suffix is redundant-but-harmless copy target. For MS Store / Xbox / any future generic-redeem-URL store, users can now redeem straight from the notification without digging into the DB.

### MS Rewards activity-card selector: fallback for the post-2026 Premium dashboard ([#102](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/102))

Reported by [kevindevm](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/102) — the same contributor whose finds shipped as v2.8.40 (RSC balance) and v2.8.50 (Ready-to-claim card). On their account the legacy `mee-card:has(.mee-icon-AddMedium)` matches zero cards because Microsoft's Premium dashboard rebuild dropped `<mee-card>` in favor of plain HTML + Tailwind. Their working proposal: match the point-value `<p>` inside each new-shape card via its Tailwind class chain (`p.text-metadata.leading-none.text-statusInformativeTintFg`).

`BING_REWARDS_ACTIVITY_CARD_SELECTOR` is now comma-unioned so Playwright's locator matches either variant:

```
mee-card:has(.mee-icon-AddMedium), p.text-metadata.leading-none.text-statusInformativeTintFg
```

Existing users still on the legacy Angular dashboard see no regression; users migrated to the Premium dashboard finally get their activity cards clicked.

kevindevm's third-in-a-row leverage-heavy MS Rewards find — the sustained pattern is now: they surface working code in the issue thread, we ship it same day.

---

## What's new in 2.8.51

**Network blips during the MS Desktop session no longer crash the whole run.** Reported by TheDevRo in [#100](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/100): a network hiccup mid-`page.goto('https://rewards.bing.com/')` caused Chromium to navigate to `chrome-error://chromewebdata/` (its built-in error page), which Playwright surfaced as `Navigation to "https://rewards.bing.com/" is interrupted by another navigation to "chrome-error://chromewebdata/"`. The throw came from `clickEveryPendingActivityCard()` and propagated out of the desktop session — skipping the **entire Bing search loop** and the **mobile session** that follow. The activity-card pass is a small extra; the search loop is the actual reward path, so it must not die for a transient.

New helper `isRecoverableMsNavError(e)` returns `true` for the family of "page/network disappeared mid-flight" errors:

- `Target page, context or browser has been closed` (browser teardown — #67 OFABLE, #80 Rick45)
- `interrupted by another navigation` (chrome-error redirect — #100 TheDevRo)
- `ERR_ADDRESS_UNREACHABLE` / `ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED` / `ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` / `ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED` / `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` / `ERR_TIMED_OUT` (DNS / connectivity failures)

`claimPendingBonusPoints` (existing) + `clickEveryPendingActivityCard` (newly wrapped) both use the helper now: try the dashboard goto, on a recoverable error log + return from the function so the rest of the MS run continues. Non-recoverable errors (real bugs, locator timeouts, etc.) still throw as before. 9/9 truth-table tests pass distinguishing the two classes.

If you saw a one-off MS run failure with a `chrome-error://chromewebdata/` or `ERR_*`-class error in the captured stack, this is the fix.

---

## What's new in 2.8.50

**MS Rewards now auto-claims the "Ready to claim" card on the post-2026 dashboard.** Found and instrumented by [kevindevm](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/99) — the same contributor who supplied the RSC-stream balance trick in v2.8.40.

What was happening: Microsoft's redesigned Rewards dashboard surfaces pending bonus points as a card in the top-bar ("Ready to claim: 3") rather than the legacy `mee-rewards-pointclaim-banner` that `claimPendingBonusPoints()` (shipped earlier) handles. The card uses a small SVG arrow + "Claim" text, and clicking it opens a modal whose CTA is "Claim points". Users on the new dashboard would see pending points pile up without auto-claim — same loss-of-credit pattern that drove the original `claimPendingBonusPoints` work, just against a different DOM surface.

New function `claimReadyToClaimCard()` in `microsoft.js` is called right after `claimPendingBonusPoints()` in both desktop and mobile run loops. Implementation matches kevindevm's working test:

1. Iterate every SVG with the dashboard's small-arrow utility-class chain (`.size-3.5.-rotate-90.rtl:rotate-90`)
2. Inspect the preceding `<p>` element for each — match exact `"Claim"`
3. On match, click the SVG, wait for the modal's "Claim points" button to render, click it
4. One card per run is the realistic shape; bail after the first successful claim

Defensive throughout: `page.isClosed()` check up front, try/catch around the whole iteration, `.catch()` on each per-element call so a missing card or single-element transient doesn't crash anything. The legacy banner path stays in place — this is additive coverage for the new surface, not a replacement.

The Tailwind class chain is stable on MS's current redesign but could drift if Microsoft does another rebuild. Our `--accept-lang=en-US` browser flag (shipped in v2.8.34's `localeArgs`) ensures the "Claim" text match works regardless of the user's account locale.

---

## What's new in 2.8.49

**Reddit-403 log wording is no longer misleading.** Reported in-chat by feldorn after seeing `! FreeGameFindings discovery skipped — Reddit API rate-limited (HTTP 403)` on a run that had only fired once that day — "rate-limited" implied their traffic volume had tripped a per-user quota, when in reality Reddit blanket-blocks the public JSON endpoint for unauthenticated clients on datacenter / container egress IPs by default. They started this in 2023 as a general anti-scraper measure; the 403 hits the first request regardless of volume.

Log line now reads:

> `Reddit API returned 403 — Reddit blocks their public JSON endpoint for unauthenticated container/datacenter traffic by default, not a user-specific rate limit. Supplementary discovery skipped; GamerPower coverage still applies.`

Same fingerprint, same no-action-required behavior (GamerPower already covers most of the same freebies). Just stops giving the impression that something on the user's side caused it.

OAuth would bypass the block but requires per-user Reddit app registration — too heavy a lift for a supplementary discovery source when GamerPower coverage is already comprehensive. The 403 is documented as the expected steady state on container egress, not a transient.

---

## What's new in 2.8.48

**New opt-in service: FAB (Epic's 3D content marketplace).** Contributed by [@ABilevich](https://github.com/ABilevich) ([#94](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/94) → [#95](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/pull/95)). Claims the monthly "Limited-Time Free" assets on [fab.com](https://www.fab.com/limited-time-free) — formerly Unreal Engine Marketplace + Quixel + Sketchfab, now Epic's unified content marketplace.

Key architectural notes:

- **Reuses the existing Epic browser profile.** FAB authenticates via Epic SSO, so when FAB runs after Epic Games in the claim chain the session is already warm — no second login, no second set of credentials, one cookie store.
- **`claimOrder: 3.5`** slots FAB right after Epic Games (3) and before the rest of the chain. No existing entries renumbered.
- **Opt-in (`FAB_ACTIVE=1`).** Default off, so existing deploys see no behavior change. Same opt-in shape as AliExpress and Lenovo Gaming Key Drops. Activate via Settings → Services → FAB.
- **Handles both free flows** seen on FAB: the standard permanent-free "Add to My Library" one-click path, and the Limited-Time-Free "Buy now" purchase discounted -100% to €0. Ownership detection keys off the "Saved in My Library" / "View in Launcher" state, with a per-asset try/catch so one bad listing can't sink the whole run.
- **Cloudflare-resilient login detection.** Both the page and the `/i/users/me` API sit behind Cloudflare, so the API is treated as a positive-only signal (confirm a name, never deny) and the rendered DOM makes the logged-out decision via visibility-checked `[aria-label="Sign in"]` matches. Same pattern oat1 / jaimitus's #72-#86 series taught us for AliExpress.
- **`fab.json` claim DB** records owned assets so the script skips re-checking them on subsequent runs.
- **Registry-driven** — the new `sites.js` entry auto-wires FAB into the panel's Sessions / Schedule / Discoveries / Stats tabs, the scheduler's claim-chain ordering, the session-check probes, and the run-summary aggregator. No engine code touched.

Scaffolded as v0.1 — fab.com is a React SPA and selectors may need iteration as Epic updates the store; per-asset try/catch + failure screenshots under `data/screenshots/fab/failed/` make the next iteration straightforward.

**Also: `docker-compose.yml` validation fix.** Same contributor, [PR #96](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/pull/96). Newer Docker Compose versions reject the file as-is — the `environment:` key had only commented-out entries (null mapping error) and the `fgc` named volume was referenced but never declared at the top level. Both fixed. If you got `docker compose: services.free-games-claimer.environment must be a mapping` on a fresh install, this is the fix.

---

## What's new in 2.8.47

**Stats tab's "Recent claims" list is now user-configurable (default 200, was hardcoded at 10).** Requested by reverendj1 in [#91](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/91): they check the panel weekly-or-less and the 10-entry cap meant they'd routinely miss titles claimed earlier in the week. Underlying per-service claim DBs always preserved everything indefinitely — only the panel display was capped.

New setting in Settings → Advanced → Logs → **"Recent claims to show on Stats tab"** (env `RECENT_CLAIMS_LIMIT`, default 200, hard ceiling 500). Default 200 covers roughly 2–3 months of typical activity. Raise to 500 if you check the panel monthly or less; lower it if you want a tighter snapshot.

Section title on the Stats tab also surfaces the count (`Recent claims · last 142`) so it's obvious at a glance whether the visible list is the full history or saturated at the configured limit.

Plumbing: server-side `/api/activity` now reads the configured default when the client doesn't pass `?limit=`. The Stats tab makes a paramless request so the user's setting applies without the client needing to round-trip `/api/config` first. Explicit `?limit=N` requests still work (e.g. for future "Show more" buttons or programmatic callers), clamped to 500.

## What's new in 2.8.46

**One stuck Epic Games page no longer crashes the whole Epic claim run.** Reported by Abateman121in [#90](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/90): `page.waitForFunction: Timeout 60000ms exceeded.` fired during the per-game CTA-button readiness wait, propagated out of the `for (const url of urls)` loop, and killed the rest of the Epic run before remaining games got a chance. Their stack showed 4 free games found (Citizen Sleeper, ROBOBEAT, Construction Simulator 3 — all already-owned or already-claimed — plus a 4th title whose name was lost when the run crashed mid-iteration).

Fix: wrapped `page.waitForFunction(...)` in a try/catch. On timeout the script logs `CTA button never loaded for <url> — skipping this game`, pushes a `failed: CTA never loaded` entry to the notification list so the run-summary surfaces the skip, and `continue`s to the next URL. The URL is in the log line specifically so future diagnostics submissions identify which page caused it without needing a `DEBUG=1` rerun.

Epic occasionally serves a broken / variant page layout for specific titles (bundles, region-restricted offers, anti-bot slow-walks) — this is the failure mode to expect rather than something we can selector-around. Skipping cleanly + naming the offending URL is the right behavior.

---

## What's new in 2.8.45

**Removed a broken native-`confirm()` gate on service-deactivation that made the toggle look unresponsive.** Reported in-conversation by feldorn: toggling Microsoft Rewards off in Settings did nothing — the switch visually shifted to "off" then snapped back to "on", and the Save button never activated. Lenovo deactivation worked fine.

The bug: `setActiveService()` called native `window.confirm()` when the service had claim history (preservation-notice dialog). Native `confirm()` is fragile across browser contexts — silently auto-cancels under pop-up blocker settings, prior site-level "block dialogs" choices, certain noVNC-iframe contexts, etc. A silent auto-cancel hit the `if (!ok) { paintSettings(); return; }` branch, which visually reverted the toggle and dropped the staged dirty patches before they reached `settingsDirty`. Save button stayed disabled because no patches were queued. Microsoft Rewards reproduced this 100% (has thousands of points of history); Lenovo didn't because the history check was false (it's a watch-only collector).

The dialog was informational-only — it just clarified that claim history is preserved and scheduled runs will skip. Save is already the explicit commit gate, so the dialog was a redundant UI barrier that introduced a real failure mode. Dropped the dialog entirely; the toggle now stages the dirty patch on click, Save commits, no native-`confirm` involvement.

## What's new in 2.8.44

**MS scheduler now invalidates the persisted daily pick when the window config changes.** Reported by Dr4w in [#88](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/88) with full repro + suggested fix location: changing `MS_SCHEDULE_HOURS` via the Settings UI didn't invalidate the previously-persisted `data/ms-schedule-today.json`, so the scheduler kept the stale pick — which could fall completely outside the new window. The only workaround was to manually delete the file and restart the container.

Fix: a new `msTargetInWindow(st, c)` predicate in `computeMsWakeMs` validates the persisted target against the *current* config's window bounds. When the target lies outside the live window, the pick is marked stale and `pickMsTargetFor()` repicks within the new window. Logged as `Scheduler (MS): persisted target … is outside the current N:00 + Mh window — repicking.` so users see the invalidation happen.

Implemented in `computeMsWakeMs` rather than `watchConfigForScheduler` because the validation catches every drift case (UI saves, direct file edits, boot-time env changes, container migrations across hosts with different time zones, manual `data/ms-schedule-today.json` edits) — not just the Settings-UI-write path. `fireSchedulerWakeups()` already triggers `computeMsWakeMs` on every config write, so the path-of-truth ordering is unchanged.

8/8 truth-table tests pass including the exact #88 repro (24h window → 1h window from 08:00, pre-picked 02:12 target detected as out-of-window).

---

## What's new in 2.8.43

**Three Settings hint-copy fixes — no behavior change, just clearer UI text.**

- **MS schedule window width hint** ([#87](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/87)) — wielorzeczownik flagged that the hint reads "0 runs immediately without anchoring" but `MS_SCHEDULE_HOURS=0` actually **disables the dedicated MS scheduler entirely** (per `legacyCombinedMode()` / `computeMsWakeMs()` guards: `if (!msActive || c.msHours <= 0) ... return 0`). Hint now reads correctly and points the user at the `Run Microsoft inline with main chain` toggle below if they want MS to run via the main daily run instead.

- **Desktop/mobile search count hints** ([#83](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/83)) — driftin8ez suggested a warning about high-volume per-run risk after sharing their setup (41 desktop + 31 mobile, split across 2 runs/day with 60-min jitter). Hints now note that values much higher than the defaults run many searches in rapid succession from one session and raise bot-detection risk — splitting the same total across 2 runs per day is safer.

---

## What's new in 2.8.42

**Configurable MS Rewards per-session search counts.** Requested by driftin8ez in [#83](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/83): their account has a 100-point daily bonus cap and the hardcoded 60-searches-per-run was overshooting, leading them to run the claimer 2× per day and still leave points on the table. Two new configFields:

- **`services.microsoft.desktopSearchCount`** (env `MS_DESKTOP_SEARCH_COUNT`, default 35)
- **`services.microsoft.mobileSearchCount`** (env `MS_MOBILE_SEARCH_COUNT`, default 25)

Defaults match the previously-hardcoded midpoints (33–37 desktop, 23–27 mobile) so existing deploys see no behavior change. A ±2 random jitter is applied around the configured center at runtime to keep the actual count human-varying — consistent counts day-after-day are a bot tell, so even at low values like 12 you'd see a 10–14 range.

Settings UI surface in *Settings → Services → Microsoft Rewards → Desktop searches per run / Mobile searches per run*. No floor enforcement (a configured value of 1 produces 1–3 actual searches via Math.max(1, …)) — trust the user, document the trade-offs in the hint copy.

---

## What's new in 2.8.41

**Three small defensive fixes from this triage round.**

### 1. `notify()` apprise failure now captures exit code + stdout + stderr ([#82](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/82))

v2.8.39 added apprise's `stderr` to the error message. jzagata's #82 (Epic-Games Pushover failure on v2.8.40) showed the new capture didn't help — apprise had exited non-zero with **empty stderr**. The actual rejection info was either in stdout (Python's `print()` default routing) or implicit in the exit code only. v2.8.41 captures all three (`exit N | stderr | stdout`) so the next failure surfaces the actual reason regardless of how apprise routes the diagnostic.

### 2. AliExpress detector last-chance attached-but-not-visible check ([#86](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/86))

jaimitus's #86 was the first AliExpress submission where the v2.8.38 chunk-buffered scanner successfully captured the full diagnostic dump — and the dump showed `"day streak"` h3 + `"Collect"` button **both in the DOM** at the moment of failure. Our `loggedIn.waitFor()` race uses `state: 'visible'` (the Playwright default), which misses elements present in the DOM but transiently hidden (display:none, opacity:0, offscreen during a layout transition). Mobile AliExpress's coin-collection panel renders through a multi-step state machine where these markers are attached well before they become paint-visible.

Before throwing, the detector now does a final `locator.count()` check on each marker (visibility-agnostic). If the logged-in marker is in the DOM but wasn't deemed visible during the race, we count it as logged-in. Same defense applied to the login-button marker on the logged-out side.

### 3. Config-snapshot rendering: `MS: undefined:00 + 4h window` ([#85](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/85))

Tiny bug surfaced by molotovah's #85 submission — when `msScheduleStart` is unset but `msScheduleHours` is configured, `_captureErrorContext` rendered `startHour` as `undefined` instead of falling back to the default 8 (which `src/config.js` uses for runtime behavior). The window string now reads `8:00 + 4h window` matching the actual runtime config.

---

## What's new in 2.8.40

**`readPointsBalance` now reads the points balance from MS's React Server Components stream instead of scraping the DOM.** Credit to [kevindevm](https://github.com/kevindevm) in [#71](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/71) for finding the approach: re-fetching `https://rewards.bing.com/dashboard` with header `rsc: 1` returns the RSC stream — a text blob carrying a literal `"balance":<N>,"level":<N>` pair — which sidesteps DOM scraping entirely.

Why this is meaningfully better than the v2.8.39 selector expansion:

- **Locale-blind.** No localized label text in the way (Spanish "Puntos disponibles", German "Punkte", etc. all return the same RSC pair).
- **Layout-redesign-immune.** The field lives in MS's data layer, not in the rendered HTML, so dashboard redesigns can shuffle the visible counter element without breaking us.
- **Cheap.** One extra `fetch()` from inside the page context, authenticated transparently by the existing session cookies. No extra navigation.
- **Single-shot.** No 5s retry / 60s timeout / selector-iteration combinatorics — the response is the source of truth.

DOM selector list is kept as a fallback for the case MS changes the RSC contract or returns an empty stream; the diagnostic dump on final-attempt miss also stays. So we gracefully degrade through three layers — RSC primary → expanded DOM selectors → diagnostic dump (which now lands in the captured stack thanks to v2.8.38's chunk-buffered scanner).

If your `0 points earned` log was a `readPointsBalance` miss (counter visible in browser, script logged null), this should clear up.

---

## What's new in 2.8.39

**Three defensive fixes after a triage round** — none of them changes user-facing behavior on the happy path, all of them sharpen the failure mode.

### 1. `claimPendingBonusPoints` no longer crashes the MS run when the page is dead ([#67](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/67), [#80](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/80))

OFABLE (v2.8.29) and Rick45 (v2.8.38) both reported `page.goto: Target page, context or browser has been closed` at `microsoft.js:631` — the first navigation inside `claimPendingBonusPoints`. The browser had died between the preceding `clickEveryPendingActivityCard()` and this call (activity-card click triggered a tab close, MS forced a sign-out, container ran out of memory — there are several possible causes). The script then crashed the entire MS run with a diagnostics-banner error for what's really a side-feature (catching pending expiring points).

`claimPendingBonusPoints` now checks `page.isClosed()` before the goto and wraps the navigation in a try/catch that recognizes the "browser closed" message specifically. On either signal, it logs and returns — the rest of the MS run completes normally instead of erroring out. The bonus-points pass is best-effort; the next daily run picks it up if the banner is still there.

### 2. `readPointsBalance` selector list expanded + diagnostic dump on miss ([#71](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/71))

kevindevm reported "0 points earned" persisting on v2.8.38 even though their balance is genuinely increasing per the manual browser check. Tracing it: the dashboard now renders correctly (no timeout), but none of our four counter selectors (`#id_rc`, `[data-bi-id="userCounter"]`, `#getPointsCounter`, `.pointsValue`) match the new Premium-dashboard layout MS has rolled out. The function returns null even when the counter is plainly visible.

Two changes:

- **Expanded selector list** with localized aria patterns (`[aria-label*="points" i]`, `[aria-label*="puntos" i]`, `[aria-label*="punkte" i]`, `[aria-label*="punkty" i]`), the `mee-rewards-counter-animation` custom element MS uses on the top-bar counter, and a few `data-testid` / `data-bi-name` candidates seen in regional rollouts.
- **Diagnostic dump on final-attempt miss** — when the second attempt also fails to find a counter, the script now prints a JSON snapshot of the page's top-of-DOM structure (h1/h2 text, aria-labels, visible 1–6-digit numeric spans). Modeled on the AliExpress detector dump that pinned [#72](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/72)'s structural anchor in one round-trip. With v2.8.38's chunk-buffered scanner, the dump now lands in the captured stack of the next diagnostics-banner submission, so we can target the actual element MS is rendering without asking the reporter for DevTools-inspected HTML.

(Side note still relevant to kevindevm's case: Bing serves the dashboard in your account's language preference, not browser locale. The "Spanish dashboard" thread is independent — fix via rewards.bing.com → ⚙️ Settings → Language to switch the account-level locale.)

### 3. `notify()` apprise failure now carries apprise's stderr ([#81](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/81))

Rick45's submission for a failing Pushover notification on a Steam claim. The auto-prefilled body showed `Command failed: apprise pover://<redacted> -i html -b steam (Rick45):<br>- ...` — but the actual reason apprise rejected the call was nowhere in the captured stack. We're using `execFile` so we always have `stderr`, but we threw away its contents before the diagnostics scanner saw them. Now apprise's `stderr` is appended to the error message (and logged separately to the run output), so the next failure surfaces the actual rejection reason — payload-too-long, token-invalid, target-unreachable, etc. — instead of just "Command failed."

If you hit a Pushover / Discord / etc. notification error after upgrading, the issue body's stack will now name the underlying problem.

---

## What's new in 2.8.38

**Diagnostics scanner now buffers context across stderr chunk boundaries.** Reported by HelpMePleasepls's submission in [#78](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/78) — the auto-prefilled issue body's stack section contained only the throw line and four stack frames, even though v2.8.33 widened the pre-error capture window to 25 lines. Tracing the bug: each `child.stderr.on('data', ...)` event fires `_scanForErrors(chunk)` with just that chunk's text, and the 25-line lookback is bounded inside that single chunk. When a script prints a multi-line diagnostic dump (e.g. AliExpress's `JSON.stringify(snapshot, null, 2)` page-state block) and then throws on the next event-loop tick, the dump and the throw end up in *separate* `data` events — and the throw's per-chunk window has no visibility into the dump's chunk.

Fix: maintain a per-stream rolling tail of the last 60 cleaned lines, prepend it to the next chunk before scanning, and only iterate the new section of the combined buffer (so dedup-by-fingerprint isn't bypassed by re-matching tail lines). `resetScanState()` clears the tails between runs so a previous run's tail can't bleed into the next run's first event. Streams keyed by `<stdout|stderr>:<child.pid>` so the two streams stay independent and concurrent processes (shouldn't happen but cheap insurance) can't collide.

Verified with five focused tests of the new path:

- ✓ Multi-line dump in chunk 1 + throw in chunk 2 → throw's captured stack now includes the dump verbatim (locale markers like `Zdobądź` survive intact)
- ✓ stdout content does not bleed into stderr stack (per-stream isolation)
- ✓ Tail re-scanning suppressed — the matched line in chunk 1 doesn't re-trigger when chunk 2 arrives
- ✓ Tail bounded at 60 lines (memory cap on long-running runs)
- ✓ `resetScanState()` correctly wipes tails + `_currentSection` between runs

If you submit a fresh diagnostics-banner issue after upgrading, the *Stack / context* `<details>` block should now carry the surrounding log lines reliably — including any explicit `console.error('diagnostic dump…')` blocks the script printed just before the exception.

---

## What's new in 2.8.37

**Panel session check for AliExpress now uses the same locale-blind selectors as the daily-run script.** Follow-up to [#72](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/72) reported by oat1 in [#75](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/75): v2.8.35 fixed `aliexpress.js auth()` and `coins()` to match AliExpress's structural `#signButton` id + state-class prefix instead of English text — but I missed `src/sites.js checkLogin()`, the function the panel calls to verify session state after a cookie import. So a Polish-locale user could import cookies, be genuinely logged in on the page, and still see the panel's session check return "not logged in" because the English-text selectors here didn't match. Same fix in the same shape — structural-first, English-text fallback — applied to `checkLogin()` so the panel agrees with reality on non-English accounts.

If you imported cookies for AliExpress on a non-English account and the panel kept saying "Login NOT detected" while the browser actually showed you logged in, this should now clear up.

---

## What's new in 2.8.36

**`readPointsBalance()` no longer reports "0 points earned" when MS is actually crediting points.** Reported by kevindevm ([#71](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/71)): the post-search dashboard load was timing out at 30s — but a manual browser check showed the balance had actually moved, the points credit had landed, the script just couldn't read it back from the throttled dashboard load. Run summary logged `0 points earned` when the user had earned points.

Two changes to `readPointsBalance()` in `microsoft.js`:

- **`waitUntil: 'load'` → `'domcontentloaded'`** — MS keeps a long tail of analytics pings and tracker requests in flight after the visible page is rendered; waiting for `load` blocks on those even though the points counter is in the DOM well before then. `domcontentloaded` lets us read the counter as soon as the JS has injected it.
- **Per-attempt timeout 30s → 60s + one retry with 5s gap** — for genuinely throttled accounts where the first dashboard load is slow, the second attempt usually clears. If both fail, we still return null (existing behavior) so the run completes; the "0 points" line then reflects "couldn't verify" rather than "MS didn't credit," with no functional difference to the user (points still landed).

If you were seeing `0 points earned` in your MS run summary despite the dashboard balance actually moving, this should clear up. The script's behavior on accounts MS is genuinely throttling (e.g. Argentina-region) hasn't changed — searches still execute the same way, MS just doesn't credit them; that's an MS-side decision unrelated to the script.

---

## What's new in 2.8.35

**Locale-blind AliExpress login + collect detection.** Reported by oat1 ([#72](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/72)) and Buddinski88 ([#74](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/74)): the AliExpress daily-coin script's three sentinel locators (`button:has-text("Log in")`, `h3:text-is("day streak")`, `button:has-text("Earn more coins")`) and the claim-time `button:has-text("Collect")` locator are all English-text matches. Polish-locale users hit `Zdobądź więcej monet` / `Odbierz` / etc., none of the locators matched, the page-load loop bailed out, and the script either errored as "page never finished loading" (#72) or timed out on a 60s `locator.click` waiting for an English button that was never going to appear (#74). v2.8.34's `--lang=en-US` flags didn't help because AliExpress treats locale as account/IP-sticky, not header-driven — oat1 confirmed `?_lang=en_US` doesn't force English either.

oat1's diagnostic dump pinned the structural anchor we needed: AliExpress emits a stable `id="signButton"` plus class-prefix `aecoin-checkInButton-*` (claim-ready) or `aecoin-taskButton-*` (already-claimed-today) regardless of page language. Both `auth()` and `coins()` in `aliexpress.js` now race the structural selectors FIRST (`#signButton[class*="aecoin-checkInButton"]` / `#signButton[class*="aecoin-taskButton"]`) and the existing English-text matches SECOND so non-English locales work without changing anything for English users and the script also stays resilient if AliExpress restructures the widget around the same id.

Login-button detection extended in the same shape: `a[href*="/login"], a[href*="/signin" i], button[data-spm*="login" i], button:has-text("Log in")` — the URL-anchor and `data-spm` (Alibaba's standard tracking attribute) anchors match across locales; the English text is the fallback.

No config change. Existing AliExpress users on English locales see no behavior change; Polish/Spanish/Russian/etc. users should now have the daily check-in actually complete.

---

## What's new in 2.8.34

**Two improvements adapted from [P-Adamiec/Free-Games-Claimer-Remaster](https://github.com/P-Adamiec/Free-Games-Claimer-Remaster) (an independent Python rewrite of the original) after auditing what they did that we don't.**

### 1. Force English at the browser-process level (every storefront)

We already force-English via URL param for Steam (`?l=english`, [#68](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/68)), but that's per-site, per-navigation. P-Adamiec's approach is broader: launch Chromium with `--lang=en-US --accept-lang=en-US,en;q=0.9 --disable-translate --disable-features=Translate,TranslateUI` so the entire browser process advertises English to every site. New helper `localeArgs()` in `src/util.js` exports the flag list; every script's `chromium.launchPersistentContext({ args: [...] })` now spreads it. Covers all 9 claim scripts (Prime, Epic, GOG, Steam, Microsoft, Humble, Fanatical, Lenovo, AliExpress) plus all 5 launch sites in the panel (interactive login, test runs).

Belt-and-suspenders with the per-site URL-param fix — if either holds, the page renders English and our existing English-text locators match. Closes the root cause for the same family of failures as [#72](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/72) (Polish AliExpress) without needing per-site URL surgery for each storefront.

### 2. GOG 2FA backup-code automation

For users with GOG two-step verification enabled, previously the daily run would stall at the 2FA prompt and require interactive VNC. New env `GOG_OTP_BACKUP_CODES` (also Settings → Services → GOG → "GOG 2FA backup codes (comma-separated)") accepts your 8-character GOG backup codes — copy them from GOG → Account Settings → Security. When the 2FA prompt fires, the script:

1. Picks the first unused code from the list
2. Navigates to `https://login.gog.com/login/two_factor/backup`
3. Fills the per-character inputs and submits
4. On success, appends the consumed code to `data/gog-used-otp-codes.txt` so the next run picks the next code

When all listed codes are exhausted, falls back to the existing interactive prompt / VNC wait — same behavior as before, just with N runs of unattended capability first. Code normalization tolerates dashes/whitespace/case (`AAAA-1111`, `aaaa 1111`, `AAAA1111` all parse the same way) so what you paste from GOG works regardless of formatting.

Leave the env empty if you don't use GOG 2FA — the existing 4-digit TOTP/SMS code prompt is untouched.

Modeled on `src/stores/gog.py` from P-Adamiec's remaster; their MIT-spirit codebase and explicit "fork-friendly" stance made the cross-pollination painless.

---

## What's new in 2.8.33

**Diagnostics submissions now carry the context I keep asking reporters for.** After auditing the round-trips on the last ~7 issues, two patterns stood out: (a) the pre-error log capture window was too small to include script-emitted diagnostic dumps (e.g. AliExpress's `JSON.stringify(snapshot, null, 2)` block that fires right before the throw in [#72](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/72)), and (b) every triage round eventually needed scheduler config + active-service list + locale + runtime info that I had to ask for separately. Both fixed.

**1. Pre-error log capture: 6 lines → 25 lines before the matched error.** Stack-window in `_scanForErrors()` now covers `i-25 .. i+15` (capped at 6000 chars after redaction), up from `i-6 .. i+14` at 4000 chars. The new window catches intentional diagnostic-dump blocks (AliExpress page snapshots, MS run summaries, etc.) instead of truncating them mid-JSON. Section headers and the run's recent log context land in the issue body without a follow-up paste.

**2. New `<details>` block: Config & run state at error time.** Each captured error now stores a non-sensitive snapshot of:

- **Scheduler:** mode (legacy-combined / decoupled / loop-only / manual), `dailyStartTime`, loop seconds, runOnStartup
- **MS scheduler:** window (start hour + width) or `inline (MS_RUN_WITH_MAIN_CHAIN=1)` or off
- **Active services:** the resolved set after `defaultActive` + Settings overrides
- **Per-service flags:** `PG_REDEEM` + max-attempts, Steam filters (`skipUnrated`, `minPrice`, `minRating`), MS pacing (`searchDelayMax`, `redeemThreshold`, `runWithMainChain`), notification level, BASE_PATH/PUBLIC_URL/NOVNC_URL presence
- **Credentials present:** per-service `yes/no` (never the value itself — purely "is this service credential-bound or cookie-only?")
- **Recent runs:** last 3 entries from `data/runs.json` — timestamp, status, claimed count, exit code
- **Runtime:** Node version, platform/arch, `LANG`, `TZ`

All available server-side at error time; nothing pulled from notification creds, no DB contents beyond the recent-run summaries. The block renders into the pre-filled issue body via a new `renderDiagnosticContext()` helper; falls back to silent skip if the field is missing (old records or future schema gaps degrade gracefully).

**What this would have closed in one round:**

- **[#68](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/68)** (truresma, Steam "no Add to Account") — `LANG=de_DE.UTF-8` would have surfaced immediately as the localization clue. Saved the screenshot round-trip.
- **[#69](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/69)** (dabziuebu4egh2, MS not running) — scheduler mode + active services + runOnStartup would have replaced the "share your scheduler config" round.
- **[#71](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/71)** (kevindevm, Argentina 0 points) — `ms_search_delay_max` value + recent-runs success/fail mix would have told us the throttle picture upfront.
- **[#72](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/72)** (oat1, AliExpress detector fail) — the full Polish page-snapshot JSON block would have been in the body verbatim (item #1 fix), and `LANG=pl_PL.UTF-8` would have confirmed the locale (item #2).
- **[#73](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/73)** (HelpMePleasepls, AliExpress cookie + fill) — the credentials-set block would have shown `aliexpress: no` immediately, pinning the diagnosis.

No UI surface — server-only changes plus the issue-body builder. Applies to both the banner Share button and the Diagnostics tab's row-level Share button.

---

## What's new in 2.8.32

**Clearer error when AliExpress can't authenticate.** Reported by HelpMePleasepls ([#73](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/73)): after importing cookies via the panel, the script crashed with `locator.fill: value: expected string, got undefined` at `aliexpress.js:129`. The actual problem was that the login-marker detector didn't recognize the post-cookie state (likely a locale or layout drift, the same family as [#68](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/68) for Steam), so the script fell through to the credential-based login flow — but with `AE_EMAIL` unset (user expected cookies to be sufficient), the `prompt()` resolved to `undefined` in the headless container and `fill()` got an opaque error.

Now the script throws a clear, user-actionable error before the `fill()` call: explains that login wasn't detected, the credential flow was reached, no `AE_EMAIL` is configured, and lists the two ways to resolve (set credentials or re-import cookies). Same guard added for the password fallback after the email prompt succeeds. No behavior change for users with both cookies *and* credentials set, or for users running with an attached terminal.

This is a diagnostics fix — it doesn't address the root cause (detector missing non-English / drifted page states). That's tracked separately in [#72](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/72) where a Polish-locale user's snapshot dump confirms the page shows "Zdobądź więcej monet" instead of the English "Earn more coins" the detector is matching against.

---

## What's new in 2.8.31

**Steam now forces store pages into English regardless of account locale.** Reported by truresma ([#68](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/68)): on a German Steam account, the claim flow logged `✗ no "Add to Account" button found` for Tell Me Why and Gravity Circuit even though both games were genuinely free-to-keep and not yet in the library. The screenshot they shared showed Steam rendering the store page in German — the actual button read "Hinzufügen" / "Zur Bibliothek hinzufügen" instead of "Add to Account", so our locator (which hardcodes the English text) never matched.

The Steam_Language=english cookie set at context-init was supposed to prevent this but evidently doesn't always stick — non-English `Accept-Language` browser headers and prior per-account language preferences both override it. The `?l=english` URL query parameter is authoritative — Steam respects it per-request regardless of cookies/headers — so `steam.js` now appends it to every store-page navigation (both `getGameDetails` and the post-click success recheck).

If you were seeing the "no Add to Account button" failure for free-to-keep games on a non-English Steam account, this should now claim them correctly. Notifications and DB rows still use the bare URL (no `?l=english` suffix) so the panel links you receive look normal.

---

## What's new in 2.8.30

**New opt-in toggle: `MS_RUN_WITH_MAIN_CHAIN`** — collapses Microsoft Rewards into the main daily run instead of the decoupled MS scheduler. Settings → Services → Microsoft Rewards → *Run Microsoft inline with main chain (skip decoupled scheduler)*, or env `MS_RUN_WITH_MAIN_CHAIN=1`. Default off (existing behavior preserved).

Background: the decoupled MS scheduler (introduced in #10) runs MS on its own daily window — anchored to `MS_SCHEDULE_START` / `MS_SCHEDULE_HOURS` — completely independently from the main Prime/Epic/GOG/Steam loop. That's the right architecture for most users (lets the MS window track Bing's daily score-reset clock), but a handful of users have reported the decoupled scheduler quietly not firing in their environment (#62, #69) and would rather just have MS run back-to-back with everything else. With the new flag on, `legacyCombinedMode()` returns true regardless of `dailyStartTime`/`loop`, so MS rolls into the same daily chain as the other claim scripts — same loop that already works reliably for them. No schedule-window settings apply in this mode.

When to flip it: turn it on if your MS Rewards scheduler has been silent ("no logs, no runs") for multiple days *despite* a configured window and active service. Turn it off (default) for the standard decoupled behavior — independent MS timing, MS continues even if the main chain breaks, etc.

## What's new in 2.8.29

**Prime Gaming → GOG auto-redeem is now self-healing on rate-limit.** Previously, when GOG's `/v1/bonusCodes/` endpoint returned `{ reason: "captcha" }` (their rate-limit signal — not a human-solvable challenge), `prime-gaming.js` gave up immediately, the code sat pending in `prime-gaming.json`, and the user had to manually click the panel's Batch Redeem button to retry. That's contrary to the platform's "unattended to the extent possible" philosophy: the rate-limit is transient and a delayed retry almost always succeeds.

New behavior — keeps the user out of the loop on the common case:

- **Same-day cooldown retry in `gog.js`.** The existing reconcile/probe pass now waits **90 seconds** and retries any code that gets a captcha response. That alone catches most rate-limits, since GOG's cooldown is typically under a minute for the kind of bursty traffic Prime Gaming's redeem flow creates.
- **Cross-run retry across multiple days.** Each pending GOG code tracks a `redeemAttempts` counter in the DB. Each daily GOG run advances the counter on persistent rate-limits, until **`PG_REDEEM_MAX_ATTEMPTS`** (default `3`, settable per Settings → Services → Prime Gaming or env) is reached. After that the code is terminal-flagged `claimed, redeem retries exhausted` and surfaces in the Prime Gaming pending-redeem reminder — the genuine "human, please intervene" signal.
- **Actually redeems valid codes.** The probe pass previously detected "valid and redeemable" codes but left them pending for manual redeem; it now clicks through to actually redeem them inline. (Same protocol as the panel's `processOneRedeemCode` — GET to confirm validity, then POST to redeem.)
- **Quieter notifications.** During the auto-retry window, Prime Gaming's pending-redeem reminder skips codes still in budget — they're being handled and don't need to surface in every daily notification. The initial-claim notification reads `"<game>: queued for next run on GOG"` instead of the older `"redeem (got captcha)"` framing that implied user action. Only the genuine give-up state (post-`MAX_ATTEMPTS`) routes back to the manual-redeem notification flow.
- **Batch Redeem button still works as the manual override.** Pending codes (in-budget or exhausted) remain visible to the panel's Batch Redeem flow — users who want to accelerate redemption without waiting for the next daily run can still click the button.

Scope: GOG only for now. Microsoft Store / Xbox / Legacy Games redeems use different protocols and haven't shown the same rate-limit pattern in reports; if it surfaces there, the same model extends naturally.

## What's new in 2.8.28

**Two log/notification-text clarifications — no behavior changes, just clearer wording.** Reported by the maintainer after reading their own logs and being puzzled twice:

- **Prime Gaming "captcha" redeem status was misleading.** When `PG_REDEEM=true` and the script tried to auto-redeem a GOG code on `gog.com/redeem`, GOG's `/v1/bonusCodes/` endpoint sometimes returns `{ reason: "captcha" }` — but that's GOG's **rate-limit response**, not a human-solvable challenge. The notification read `"<game>: redeem (got captcha) on GOG"`, which sounds like the user needs to solve a captcha. In practice, the panel's **Batch Redeem** button retries the same code after the rate-limit cools and usually succeeds without intervention. The status now reads `"rate-limited (use Batch Redeem) on GOG"` and the log warn names the right next step (`"GOG rate-limited the redeem (their 'captcha' reason); click Batch Redeem in the panel to retry"`). Internal state machine is identical — just the user-facing text changed.

- **FreeGameFindings Reddit 403 message is now self-explanatory.** The warn line `FreeGameFindings discovery skipped — reddit API: 403` left users wondering whether something was broken (it isn't — Reddit's unauthenticated API rate-limits aggressively, especially on container egress IPs). The thrown error from `src/freegamefindings.js` is now a full sentence: `Reddit API rate-limited (HTTP 403) — supplementary discovery skipped; GamerPower coverage still applies`. Same code path, the log just doesn't leave you guessing.

## What's new in 2.8.27

**Stop button no longer triggers a false-positive diagnostic banner.** Pair to 2.8.26: when SIGTERM tears down a script mid-Playwright-operation, the navigation/click in progress throws `Target page, context or browser has been closed` — a perfectly expected side-effect of the user pressing Stop, *not* a bug. But our diagnostics-banner regex was capturing it as a `page.goto` error and prompting the user to share it. Reported by the maintainer immediately after exercising 2.8.26's new fast-stop.

Fix: `src/util.js` now tracks a `shutdownRequested` flag (set by the same SIGTERM/SIGINT handler that aborts pending `delay()` calls). `log.exception` checks it: when shutdown was requested *and* the error message matches the "browser closed" family, it logs `⏹ Aborted (stop requested): <msg>` instead of `✗ Exception: <msg>`. The new prefix doesn't match the diagnostics-banner regex, so no false positive. Other errors during shutdown (e.g. unrelated TypeError) still surface normally — only the known-benign pattern is suppressed.

---

## What's new in 2.8.26

**The Stop button can now interrupt long sleeps mid-run.** Previously, hitting Stop during a long `await delay(...)` (e.g. `MS_SEARCH_DELAY_MAX_SEC=1200` could mean a 20-minute pause between Bing searches) sent SIGTERM but the script would just sit in the timer until it fired — Node's default behavior is to keep the event loop alive while a `setTimeout` is pending. So Stop "worked" but you'd wait minutes for the run to actually exit. Reported during a config-change-mid-run case.

Two complementary fixes:

1. **`delay()` is now interruptible.** `src/util.js`'s sleep helper now registers SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers that abort all pending delays on signal. A 20-minute sleep aborts in ~200 ms when the signal arrives. Every caller (`await delay(ms)`) gets the new behavior with no API change.
2. **`/api/stop-run` now escalates to SIGKILL after 15 s.** Belt-and-braces: if any other operation (Playwright nav, a stuck redirect, a hanging websocket) doesn't bubble up the SIGTERM cleanly, the panel force-kills the process group. 15 s is enough headroom for the script to unwind voluntarily; anything still running after that is genuinely hung.

Combined, Stop now goes from "indefinite wait" → "sub-second cancel" in the common case, with a hard ceiling at 15 s for the exotic stuck-on-something-else case.

Note: configuration changes still don't propagate mid-run (each claim script reads `cfg` once at boot). The clean pattern remains: change config, click Stop, the run exits fast now, hit Run again to start fresh with the new settings.

## What's new in 2.8.25

**Steam unrated-game filter is now opt-out, not always-on** ([#61](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/61)). The Steam claim filter has always skipped games with zero Steam reviews (`details.rating === null`) under the assumption that "no rating = probably shovelware." But launch-day free indies often legitimately have zero reviews and get missed — @hanafytech reported wanting *IQ Under Construction* (Steam appId 3771740) which was free but got skipped on `no reviews (unrated)`.

New setting **`services.steam.skipUnrated`** (env `STEAM_SKIP_UNRATED`) controls the behavior:

- **Default `true`** — preserves long-standing behavior, no surprises for existing users
- **Set `false`** — unrated games pass the rating filter and proceed to the price filter (so a $10 minPrice still applies; this isn't "claim everything"). Useful for catching launch-day freebies before reviews accumulate.

Available on the Settings tab → Services → Steam, or via the `STEAM_SKIP_UNRATED` env var (legacy fallback). Either way, it's a one-toggle change with backwards-compatible default.

---

## What's new in 2.8.24

**Scheduler no longer gets permanently stuck on a phantom `runProcess`** ([#62](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/62)). @dabziuebu4egh2 reported the main scheduler logging `Cannot start run — claim run in progress (panel:microsoft)` once per minute for 20+ minutes, but with no actual MS process running in the logs. Root cause: the `runProcess` cleanup only fires on the child's `close` / `error` events. If the child dies via a path that doesn't trigger those (host OOM-kill, signal swallowed, abnormal exit), `runProcess` stays set forever and every scheduler tick reports "busy" against a phantom.

Two fixes:

1. **Defensive aliveness check in `browserBusy`.** When `runProcess` is set, the function now verifies the underlying pid is actually alive via a `process.kill(pid, 0)` signal-0 probe (costs nothing — no signal sent, just probes the kernel). If the pid is gone, state is cleared automatically with a log line, and the panel proceeds as not-busy. Self-healing on the next scheduler tick.

2. **10-minute backoff in `mainSchedulerLoop` on blocked attempts.** Mirrors 2.8.11's MS-scheduler fix: when `fireScheduledRun` returns false (blocker — another run in progress, batch redeem, interactive Login, etc.), back off 10 min before the next wake instead of tight-looping at `computeMainWakeMs`'s 60 s floor. Even with a *genuinely-long* blocker (not a stale pid), this prevents 60 "Cannot start run" log lines per hour.

Together: stale state self-clears on next scheduler tick (#1); real long-lived blockers no longer spam logs (#2).

## What's new in 2.8.23

**Prime Gaming Legacy Games redeem now bails cleanly when `LG_EMAIL` isn't set** ([#63](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/63)). With `PG_REDEEM=true` and no `LG_EMAIL` / `PG_EMAIL` / `EMAIL` env var, `cfg.lg_email` was `undefined` and got passed straight to `page.fill('[name=email]', undefined)` — Playwright threw `page.fill: value: expected string, got undefined`, surfacing as a generic cryptic exception that silently failed the redemption. Reported by @bgiesing trying to redeem Nordic Storm Solitaire.

Fix: a pre-check guards the Legacy Games redeem branch. If `cfg.lg_email` is unset, the redeem action is marked `redeem (LG_EMAIL not set)`, the DB row gets `status: 'failed:LG_EMAIL not set'`, and the notification body says exactly which env var to set. The code is still preserved in the DB so a later run with `LG_EMAIL` configured can redeem it.

## What's new in 2.8.22

**Privacy fix: diagnostics now redacts apprise webhook URLs and embedded credentials before storing** ([#66](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/66)). When an apprise CLI call failed, the full command line — including the live discord webhook / pushover token / mailto password — was being captured verbatim into `data/diagnostics-state.json` and surfaced in the Share-to-GitHub flow. @bgiesing had to manually redact a discord webhook from their auto-generated issue body before posting. That's a real credential-exposure risk: users with less time or attention could paste their webhook publicly.

Fix: a `_redactCredentials` pre-processor now runs on every message and stack line before it's fingerprinted, stored, or shared. It targets:

- **Apprise notifier URLs** across 26 schemes (`discord://`, `pover://`, `tgram://`, `slack://`, `mailto[s]://`, `msteams://`, `ntfy[s]://`, `pushbullet://`, `pushover://`, `gotify://`, `matrix[s]://`, `twilio://`, `signal://`, `rocket[s]://`, `xmpp[s]://`, `webex[api]://`, `wxteams[api]://`, `mattermost[s]://`) — replaced with `<scheme>://<redacted>`
- **URL-embedded credentials** (`scheme://user:password@host`) in any scheme — replaced with `<scheme>://<credentials-redacted>@host`
- **Bearer tokens** and `api_key=...` / `token=...` patterns in body text — replaced with `<redacted>`

The fingerprint is computed AFTER redaction, so the same error across token rotations still collapses to one DB row. 9/9 sandbox cases pass; pure error messages without credentials (ReferenceError, page.goto network errors, etc.) are untouched.

**If you've previously used the Share button on a diagnostic involving an apprise failure**, please review your `data/diagnostics-state.json` and consider rotating any webhooks/tokens that may have appeared in submitted issue bodies. Existing entries on disk can be retroactively scrubbed with the same redaction logic — happy to provide the one-liner if you ask.

## What's new in 2.8.21

**Stats now counts manually-rescued Epic claims.** Epic's claim script sets `status: 'manual'` on entries where a previous attempt was marked `failed:*` but a later run found the game in the user's library — i.e. the user manually rescued it through Epic's website after our script gave up. The game *is* claimed; the `manual` label just records that the user, not the script, completed it. `readAllClaims` was filtering on `status.startsWith('claimed')` only, so these rescued claims were invisible to Stats — same shape as the pre-2.8.20 Prime bug, just narrower scope.

Fix: the filter now accepts `manual` alongside `claimed*`. Same precedent as Discoveries-marked manual claims being counted since 2.8.1 (it's still a real claim from the user's POV, even though the script didn't drive it).

Plus a small Steam DB-hygiene chore: a one-time backfill at script start stamps `status: 'skipped:legacy'` on any historical Steam row without a status field — these were rows tracked for games no longer in Steam's current free-games-list, so they couldn't self-heal through the regular filter loop. No user-visible behavior change from the Steam piece; just makes a cold read of `steam.json` self-explanatory.

---

## What's new in 2.8.20

**Pure-Prime claims now actually show up in Stats** — fixing a long-standing data-completeness bug. The internal-Prime claim path in `prime-gaming.js` wrote DB rows with `time`, `url`, `store: 'internal'` — but **no `status` field**. External-store paths (Epic/GOG/MS Store/Legacy) always set `status: 'claimed'` after their click; the internal path never did. `readAllClaims` filters on `status.startsWith('claimed')`, so **every pure-Prime claim ever made on this fork was silently missing from the Stats tab** (KPIs, Per-service, Daily chart, Recent Claims).

The bug is at least as old as the fork. Caught by the maintainer noticing 2 games in Stats vs 3 actually claimed today (Pro Basketball Manager 2026 was the missing one — pure Prime). On the maintainer's instance, the backfill recovered **19 historical claims** (all-time jumped 113 → 132).

Fix in two parts:
1. **Write site (`prime-gaming.js:229-ish`):** internal path now mirrors the external pattern — `db.data[user][title].status = 'claimed'` after the click, matching how Epic/Legacy/GOG redeems already set their status.
2. **One-time auto-backfill (top of `prime-gaming.js`):** at the start of every run, sweep `db.data` and set `status: 'claimed'` on any `store: 'internal'` row that's missing one. Safe because the row only exists if the click landed (line 229 runs after the await). Idempotent on already-set entries. Anyone with historical pure-Prime claims will see their Stats correct themselves on the next Prime run.

No changes needed on the user's end beyond pulling `:latest` and letting the next scheduled Prime run execute (or hitting Run Now). The Stats tab will reflect the backfilled history.

## What's new in 2.8.19

**Epic Games: all claims were silently failing — checkout button text changed.** Around 2026-05-28 Epic relabeled the confirm button in their checkout modal (`#webPurchaseContainer` iframe) from **"Place Order"** to **"Add to library"**. The script's two click sites still targeted the old text, so the click never fired and `Promise.race()` timed out without any captcha — every Epic claim silently failed and got mis-classified as "captcha-failed." Caught and diagnosed in detail by @amphoterism on [#59](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/59), with the exact selector locations and a screenshot of the new button.

Fix: both locators (main claim path, `epic-games.js` ~line 500, and retry path ~line 637) now match **either** button text — `button:has-text("Add to library")` *or* `button:has-text("Place Order")`. Both preserve the existing `:not(:has(.payment-loading--loading))` guard. Keeping the old text as a fallback means we stay resilient if Epic flips back or surfaces "Place Order" in some regions / flows.

Pull `:latest` (build is auto-publishing) — Epic claims work again. Three free games this week (Calico, LONESTAR, Northgard) are still available, so a manual run after the pull should catch them.

## What's new in 2.8.18

**MS Rewards: SwiftShader + explicit WebGL flags to harden the WebGL fingerprint.** Follow-on to 2.8.15 after @mzernetsch's data on [#56](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/56) made clear that result-clicking alone wasn't his lever — his solution was a bundle, and GPU/WebGL flags were in it. In a container with no GPU passthrough, Chromium without these flags can end up with WebGL either disabled or in a weird "broken-WebGL" state — both are stronger bot tells than a clean software-rendered WebGL fingerprint.

`microsoft.js`'s `createContext` now passes `--use-gl=swiftshader --enable-webgl` alongside the existing `--ignore-gpu-blocklist --enable-unsafe-webgpu`. SwiftShader gives Chromium a known, consistent software renderer (vendor "Google Inc.", renderer "Google SwiftShader") that looks like a real browser doing software rendering, instead of "no WebGL." Isolated to microsoft.js — other claim scripts use their own launches and aren't affected.

Paired (this same day) with a Settings-side bump of `MS_SEARCH_DELAY_MAX_SEC` to 1200 s (was 180 s) — wider random delay between searches further lowers the cumulative-volume signal MS's risk model tracks. Deliberately bundled (vs. staged single-variable testing) because the cost of waiting on an account already showing the banner is real and the per-flag risk is low.

---

## What's new in 2.8.17

**Lenovo "drop is LIVE" notification now fires even if we're catching up late.** The wake-firing path suppressed *any* wake more than 5 minutes past its target (to avoid stale backlog pings after a container restart). That's right for the pre-alerts — a late "drop in 1 hour" is just confusing — but wrong for the at-drop "LIVE NOW" wake: a limited-key Lenovo drop is usually still claimable for a while after it opens, so a late "it's live, hurry" is still actionable.

Now the suppression threshold is per-kind: `1h-before` / `5min-before` stay at 5 minutes; `wentLive` is allowed up to **12 hours** late before suppressing — long enough to cover a same-day restart across the drop moment, bounded so we don't ping about a drop that's days gone. (`computeNextLenovoWake` already excludes ended/expired/postponed drops, so a `wentLive` wake only exists for one we still believe is live.) When it does fire late, the body is honest about it — "drop is LIVE … Went live ~Nh ago — keys may be limited" instead of an inaccurate "LIVE NOW".

---

## What's new in 2.8.16

**Lenovo drop notifications now re-arm when Lenovo reschedules a drop** — follow-up to 2.8.6. That release fixed the stale-`scheduledAt` refetch (a "Coming Soon" drop whose date Lenovo had bumped), but it corrected only the *date*, not the per-drop wake flags. So a drop whose `1h-before` / `5min-before` / `wentLive` wakes had already been marked sent — against the earlier, now-past date — inherited those "done" flags after the date was corrected, and the real drop-time notification never fired.

Concretely: "Heavy Rain - Game Key Drops pt. 2" was scheduled Apr 15, its three wakes got marked sent on May 14 (suppressed as ">5min late" against the stale April date), 2.8.6 corrected the date to May 27, and then the May 27 drop went live with **no notification** because `computeNextLenovoWake` skips wakes already flagged sent.

Fix: when the watcher detects a drop's `scheduledAt` has actually changed, it now resets the `1h-before` / `5min-before` / `wentLive` flags (keeping `discovered` and `restocked`) so all three pushes re-fire against the new date. Same-date re-confirmations don't reset anything. Verified across reschedule / unchanged / new-drop cases.

Note: a drop that already fired silently before this release (its date is now correct but flags are stale) won't retroactively notify — its wakes are in the past and get suppressed as late. This fix prevents the silent-miss on the *next* reschedule.

---

## What's new in 2.8.15

**MS Rewards search loop now clicks results occasionally, to look more human.** A maintainer hit the *"Unusual search activity may limit your ability to earn points"* banner on a clean residential IP with default timing and matching geo — which rules out IP reputation, velocity, and geo-mismatch, pointing at behavioral detection. The biggest tell: our search loop searched and left **every** time, never clicking a result. Real users who search almost always click something.

`executeBingSearch` now, ~30% of the time, clicks one of the top organic results (biased toward the top 5, where humans click), dwells 2.5–6.5 s like someone reading, and occasionally scrolls — then the next search re-navigates to bing.com as before. The click registers engagement via Bing's own tracking; the destination navigation is incidental. The whole block is best-effort and wrapped — a missing or odd result can never break the search loop.

This is a behavioral-detection mitigation, not a guarantee. If you're on a datacenter/VPS/VPN IP, that's a separate (and stronger) trigger we can't fix from code. See the tracking issue for the full detection-signal breakdown and to report whether you're seeing the banner too.

## What's new in 2.8.14

**New "Hide rewards / DLC" filter on the Discoveries tab.** r/FreeGameFindings posts a lot of non-game freebies — in-game outfits, skins, currency packs, GPU/points-gated cosmetic rewards — that land in the "Other" bucket with no price. Because they have no price, the "Min price" filter couldn't catch them (it deliberately keeps unknown-price items so it doesn't false-hide real games we couldn't price), so they cluttered the games view. Example: two `007 First Light - … Outfit` rows that looked like duplicates but were distinct cosmetic giveaways.

The new checkbox (default on, alongside "Hide claimed" / "Hide ignored / skipped") filters items whose title matches a conservative keyword list — `outfit, skin, cosmetic, emote, avatar, wrap, charm, currency, coin(s), gem(s), credit(s), booster, loot, in-game item, dlc` — with word-boundary matching (so "Cities: **Skylines**" doesn't trip "skin"). `bundle` and `pack` are intentionally excluded since they appear in legitimate free-game titles. Items you've explicitly marked as manually-claimed are never hidden by this filter. The toggle state persists per-browser like the others.

Note: this was **not** a dedup bug — the two 007 rows were genuinely different outfits with distinct titles/URLs. 2.8.5's dedup only collapses the *same* item appearing across GamerPower + FGF.

---

## What's new in 2.8.13

**Two root causes behind 2026-05-25's MS-blocked-by-Epic incident finally chased down** (2.8.11 + 2.8.12 were the safety nets; this is the primary fix).

- **False-positive "session expired" notifications.** Every site's `checkLogin()` had a bare `} catch {} → return { loggedIn: false }`. When Epic's `page.goto()` timed out 21 s into a 20 s budget right after a heavy claim run, the timeout was silently swallowed and reported as "definitely logged out." `postRunSessionCheck` only filters out entries with an `error` field — which the catch never set — so a network blip masqueraded as a real logout and fired the notification. All 7 site `checkLogin` catches now `catch (e)` and return `error: e.message`; `postRunSessionCheck`'s existing filter then correctly classifies it as "couldn't check" and stays quiet.

- **Double-launch on notification taps.** `launchSite()` had `if (activeBrowser) await closeBrowser()` — unconditional. When a Pushover notification tap fires the `?login=epic-games` deep-link twice in rapid succession (common across mobile clients), the second call closed the first's browser and opened a fresh context. The user's "I'm Logged In" click then raced the second launch — the verify hit a stale UI or never reached the new context — and the second `activeBrowser` was orphaned. Now: if the request is for the *same* siteId as the existing `activeBrowser`, the launch is idempotent and reuses the existing context with a log line.

Together with 2.8.11's 10-min blocked-attempt backoff and 2.8.12's 30-min stale-session timeout, the morning's exact sequence wouldn't have produced a missed MS slot: the false-positive notification doesn't fire, the double-launch doesn't orphan a second context, and even if it did the timeout cleans it up.

---

## What's new in 2.8.12

**Stale interactive Login sessions now auto-close after 30 minutes.** Companion fix to 2.8.11 — the underlying cause of yesterday's MS slot rolling over was an Epic Games **Login** session left open for 5+ hours (the Login button on a site card sets a server-side `activeBrowser` flag that only clears when the user clicks "I'm Logged In" or the browser is explicitly closed). Without a timeout, a forgotten Login session blocks every scheduler attempt and every manual Run until someone notices.

Fix:
- `activeBrowser` now records an `openedAt` timestamp at launch.
- A new `expireStaleActiveBrowser()` helper auto-closes the session when it's been open longer than 30 minutes. 30 min is generous — typical logins complete in <5 min, captcha solves take <10 min, so anything older is "the user forgot."
- `fireScheduledRun` (the scheduler fire path) and `/api/run-all` / `/api/run-service` (manual Run buttons) call the helper before checking the busy lock. A stale session is closed, then the run proceeds normally.
- A session inside the 30-min window is still respected — won't disrupt a real in-progress login.

A clean Auto-close emits a log line: `Auto-closing stale Epic Games login session — open 47 min, exceeded 30-min idle threshold.` so it's discoverable in the panel logs without being invisible.

This + 2.8.11's blocked-attempt backoff together mean: short blockers ride out the 10-min retries; longer-lived stale sessions get preempted. The MS slot survives both modes.

---

## What's new in 2.8.11

**MS scheduler now backs off cleanly when blocked by another site's session.** Observed on 2026-05-25: the MS run was scheduled for 09:58 inside an 8:00–12:00 window, but Epic Games' interactive browser session was held for the entire morning (likely a "Show browser" tab left open). Every blocked attempt fell through to the v2.8.3 sub-case 2 (repick within remaining window) — which tightens as time passes — yielding 7 rapid retries between 09:58 and 11:59, then rolled to tomorrow when the remaining window dropped below the 90s floor.

Fix: when `fireScheduledRun` returns `false` for a blocked attempt (another site's interactive browser, an in-progress run, batch redeem in flight, …), the MS scheduler pushes the target forward by a fixed **10-minute backoff** instead of recomputing via remaining-window jitter. If the backed-off target would land past today's window end, the slot is marked missed and rolls to tomorrow. The remaining-window-jitter path stays in use for its actual purpose — recovering a fresh container boot inside today's window or a target lost to a restart (v2.8.3, #47).

Today's missed slot can't be recovered programmatically (the window passed by 2.5 hours by the time the fix shipped) — clicking **Run** on the Microsoft Rewards Sessions card runs MS now regardless of schedule. The fix protects future blocked attempts.

---

## What's new in 2.8.10

**Richer diagnostics submissions** (driven by [#50](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/50) — flipside101's `[diagnostics] Error in Prime Gaming: All promises were rejected` had a single-line stack with no signal about which selector race actually failed). Three changes work together so future reports auto-include the bits we'd otherwise have to ask the reporter for:

- **Source-side: new `log.exception(err)` helper.** Replaces the `log.fail(\`Exception: ${error.message || error}\`)` boilerplate in every claim script's top-level catch (prime-gaming, epic-games, gog, steam, lenovo-gaming). For `AggregateError` (the shape `Promise.any` rejects with), it also emits `cause[i]: …` lines with the first 2 lines of each inner failure — so a Playwright `Promise.any(['Sign in', 'logged-in marker'])` race that fails now records the timeout error AND the specific selector that didn't match, instead of just the generic "All promises were rejected" message.

- **Capture-side: leading context.** The diagnostics scanner now grabs **6 lines before** the match in addition to **14 lines after** (was 0 + 10), and bumps the per-entry stack cap from 2 KB to 4 KB. The matched line is prefixed with `>> ` so a reader can find it inside the captured block. Section header, prior status lines, and `log.warn` breadcrumbs that preceded the crash are now in the captured stack — usually more useful for triage than 10 lines of Node-internal frames.

- **Fingerprint distinction across `Promise.any` sites.** Previously, two different `Promise.any` failures in the same script (e.g. Prime Gaming's login-state race vs its claim-button race) both collapsed to the fingerprint `(prime-gaming, Error, "All promises were rejected")` — a user shares one and future hits on the *other* site go silent. The fingerprint now also incorporates the first cause line + its selector continuation, so the two sites get distinct fingerprints while same-site repeats (with only line:col differences) still dedup.

Sandbox-tested: 8/8 `log.exception` output cases, 5/5 capture-window assertions, 5/5 fingerprint-distinction cases.

---

## What's new in 2.8.9

**Two follow-ups to 2.8.8's `PG_BASE_URL`:**

- **Settings UI exposure.** The Luna base URL is now a regular Settings → Services → Prime Gaming field (next to "Redeem keys on external stores", etc.) — same as every other per-service setting. The `PG_BASE_URL` env var still works as a fallback when nothing is set in the UI; the resolution order is Settings > env > default, matching every other config field. Removed the redundant Environment-tab entry from 2.8.8 — it now appears in Settings only.
- **`checkLogin()` regression fix.** `src/sites.js`'s prime-gaming `checkLogin()` still had a literal `'https://luna.amazon.com/claims'` from before 2.8.8's `PG_BASE_URL` refactor — meaning the session-status check would hit the US domain even when `PG_BASE_URL` was set. Now uses `this.loginUrl` so it follows the same configured base.

## What's new in 2.8.8

**Country-specific Amazon Luna domains now supported via `PG_BASE_URL` ([#52](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/52)).** atulrnt reported that Amazon BE redirects users to `luna.amazon.com.be` and the panel rejected cookies from that domain (host-mismatch in the cookie-import check) while `luna.amazon.com` was hard-coded in two places: `prime-gaming.js`'s `BASE_URL` and `SITES['prime-gaming'].loginUrl`.

Set `PG_BASE_URL=https://luna.amazon.com.be` (or whatever country-specific host Amazon redirected you to) and both paths follow: the cookie-import host check accepts cookies from that domain, the per-card "Open browser" button navigates there, and `prime-gaming.js` constructs all claim URLs against that base. The `SITES.loginUrl` is now a getter so the env-var resolves at access time — no module-level snapshot.

Default remains `https://luna.amazon.com` so existing deploys see no behavior change. Trailing slash is trimmed at config-read time. The variable also shows up under Environment → Prime Gaming with usage notes.

**Boot-time X server hang on container restarts ([#41](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/41), [#51](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/51)).** Sahibishere's TurboVNC log finally showed the smoking gun: `_XSERVTransmkdir: Cannot create /tmp/.X11-unix with root ownership`, followed by `Killing Xvnc process ID 24 / Xvnc seems to be deadlocked`, and only ~2 minutes later does a second Xvnc successfully start. WaBiiZ's diagnostics-banner-submitted issue (#51) was the same root cause — Steam's `browserType.launchPersistentContext: Target page, context or browser has been closed`, with `Looks like you launched a headed browser without having a XServer running` in the stack — the panel had spawned a claim run inside that 2-minute hang window.

Root cause: `/tmp/.X11-unix` was persisting across runs with mismatched ownership (different PUID between restarts, podman userns mapping, prior-root-now-non-root flip). When TurboVNC came up as a non-root user, its `_XSERVTransmkdir` couldn't reset the dir's ownership, so the first Xvnc instance hung on the retry, got killed by the supervisor, and a fresh Xvnc started ~2 min later. The existing entrypoint cleanup only removed the inner `X1` socket file, not the dir itself.

Fix: while still root (i.e. before any `gosu` drop to PUID/PGID), the entrypoint now `rm -rf /tmp/.X11-unix` and recreates it as `drwxrwxrwt root:root` (mode 1777 — the standard X11 socket dir convention). The block is guarded on `id -u == 0` so the re-exec'd, non-root second pass of the entrypoint skips it correctly. Verified end-to-end: poisoned `/tmp/.X11-unix` (mode 700, owned by an unmapped uid) recovers cleanly on restart — Xvnc creates its socket inside the freshly-permissioned dir and xdpyinfo's protocol probe succeeds on the first try, no 2-minute deadlock.

## What's new in 2.8.6

**Lenovo Gaming "Coming Soon" drops no longer stick at a stale `due now` date when Lenovo reschedules.** A drop's date is pulled once from the embedded tickcounter.com countdown widget on the drop's detail page and then cached in `data/lenovo-gaming-watch.json`. Previously the scraper only re-fetched the detail page when the drop was newly discovered or when its `scheduledAt` was missing entirely — so if Lenovo bumped the date (e.g. April 15 postponed to May 27), our copy stayed on April 15 forever and the panel kept showing `Apr 15 · due now`.

Fix: refetch the detail page whenever a `coming-soon` drop's stored `scheduledAt` is in the past. The condition is narrow (active drops with past `scheduledAt` are correctly "live now" — no refetch needed) and only fires per-drop, so it doesn't add meaningful overhead to a watch cycle. Verified end-to-end against a real Lenovo drop ("Heavy Rain pt. 2") that had drifted 5 weeks stale: one watch run picked up the new date.

## What's new in 2.8.5

**GOG notifications no longer list the same game twice ([#48](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/48)).** xeropresence reported the "Warhammer Skulls 2026 Digital Goodie Bag" appearing twice in a single GOG notification — once as `(existed)` from the library scan, again as `(via FGF)` from the FreeGameFindings supplementary discovery loop. Steam dedups by appId and Epic uses an "already in queue" check, but GOG's GP/FGF blocks didn't dedup against the library-scan entries already in `notify_games`.

Fix: when GamerPower or FGF iterate their entries, they now check the normalized title against the set of titles the GOG library scan already pushed (regardless of status — claimed or existed) and skip pushing a duplicate. Cross-source dedup also works in both directions (GP-first then FGF, or vice versa). The "Tower of Time" mass-listing test case from 2.8.4's Discoveries-marked-games dedup still passes — the two checks are complementary.

---

## What's new in 2.8.4

**Discoveries-tab marks now suppress duplicate notifications.** If you marked a game as manually-claimed or ignored on the Discoveries tab, subsequent Steam/GOG claim runs no longer emit notification lines for that same game when they re-discover it via GamerPower or FreeGameFindings. Previously a "Tower of Time (via GamerPower)" or "(existed)" line would still show up in the notify body, despite the user having already triaged it in the panel — exactly the spam case the Discoveries-tab marks were supposed to silence.

What the fix does: each claim script loads `data/discoveries-state.json` at start, builds the same `${collector}::${matchKey(title)}` dedup-key set the panel uses, and skips notify-list pushes for any GamerPower / FGF / already-owned entry whose key matches. The shared helper lives in `src/util.js` (`matchKey`, `stripGpTail`, `getDiscoveryUserMarkedKeys`) so all scripts agree on the key shape.

Edge case worth knowing: the GamerPower title-suffix stripper only matches the "(Storefront) Giveaway" shape — GP listings like "Tower of Time (Steam) **Key** Giveaway" keep the "Steam Key Giveaway" in their dedup key. A bare Steam product title ("Tower of Time") won't match that fuller key, so the very next Steam run might still emit one (existed) line. After that, the steam-games.json DB records `status='existed'` and future runs skip silently.

---

## What's new in 2.8.3

**Today's MS Rewards slot no longer gets skipped when the container restarts mid-window ([#47](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/47)).** Two related bugs in the decoupled MS scheduler conspired to drop today's run:

- **Fresh-boot picker.** When the panel booted inside the MS window with no prior state file, `pickMsTargetFor` chose a uniform-random offset across the *full* `[msStart, msStart+msHours]` window — including hours already past. The very next check ("pending + target ≤ now") then marked the slot missed and rolled to tomorrow. With an 8–12 window and a 10am first boot, ~50% of users were silently losing today's MS run.
- **Restart inside the window.** If a container update (watchtower, image pull, host reboot) happened between the picked target and run completion, the persisted state was still `pending` and `target ≤ now` on next boot. The same one-shot "mark missed" path triggered.

Fix:
- `pickMsTargetFor` now constrains the random offset to the *remaining* window when picking for today mid-window. The full window is still fair game for tomorrow's pick.
- Boot-time `computeMsWakeMs` now distinguishes three sub-cases when it finds a pending+past target: (1) `last-runs.json` shows MS already ran successfully today between target and now → mark fired and move on; (2) still inside today's MS window → repick a fresh target in the remaining window (60s minimum delay, randomized for anti-detection variance); (3) past window end → mark missed as before.

The "missed runs need manual recovery" principle is preserved for true wake-drift (`feedback_missed_runs_manual_recovery.md`) — this fix only auto-recovers when we can plausibly still fit in today's window.

5/5 sandbox sub-cases pass, plus 100/100 fresh-boot-mid-window picks land in the remaining window (was ~50%).

## What's new in 2.8.2

**Two follow-ups to 2.8.1.**

**Manual claims now persist the store URL.** When you mark an item on the Discoveries tab, the source URL (Steam page, itch.io page, GamerPower entry, …) is saved alongside the title and timestamp. Recent Claims rows then become clickable links the same way auto-claimed entries always have been. Existing manual claims from before this version don't have a URL stored — they now render in italic with a "· no link" hint so you can tell at a glance which rows are clickable vs not. Mark them again from the Discoveries tab to attach a URL.

**Update-available link goes to the CHANGELOG.** The "Update available" pill previously pointed at GitHub's bare `/releases/tag/vX.Y.Z` page, which just shows the tagged commit with no notes. It now jumps directly to the matching `## What's new in X.Y.Z` section in `CHANGELOG.md` so you can read what's in the new version before pulling.

---

## What's new in 2.8.1

**Discoveries manual-claims now count toward Stats.** When you mark a game as manually-claimed on the Discoveries tab (✓ button), it now shows up on the Stats tab — KPIs (this week / this month / all-time), Recent Claims, the 30-day chart, and the per-service table all include manual claims alongside auto-claims. New "discovery-only" storefronts (IndieGala, itch.io, STOVE, Mobile, Console, VR, Other) get their own row in the per-service table when you've manually-claimed at least one item from that source — empty rows aren't added for users who don't use Discoveries.

Manual claims for storefronts that also have an auto-claim script (Epic, Steam, GOG, Prime, Ubisoft) roll into that script's existing row — the per-game dedup (by `service` + normalized title) keeps the most-recent record, so marking an item manually that the auto-claimer later picks up doesn't double-count it.

Reported in the 2.8.0 dev cycle: "in discovery, if i mark a game as collected, it's not showing in stats."

## What's new in 2.8.0

**Error reporting — opt-out telemetry that helps the project ship faster, without ever sending anything you didn't approve.** Three pieces ship together:

- **Detection.** Every run's stdout/stderr is scanned for crashes (`ReferenceError`, `TypeError`, `Error:`, Playwright `browserType.*` / `page.*` / `locator.*`, apprise `Command failed:`, and the `Exception:` wrapper our claim scripts use). Each error is fingerprinted (SHA-1 of script + class + normalized message) so the same crash hitting on every run counts up instead of stacking duplicates. State persists at `data/diagnostics-state.json`.
- **Banner.** When an unresolved error is detected, a warm-amber banner appears at the top of the panel with three buttons: **Share** (opens a pre-filled GitHub issue in a new tab — you review and edit the body before submitting), **Don't Share** (dismiss just this one), **Never Share** (turn off the feature entirely; a Settings → Notifications checkbox flips it back on). Decisions are sticky per-error.
- **Diagnostics tab.** Full history of detected errors with a fourth `Resolved` state for tracking whether an upstream issue got fixed. Per-row actions adapt to the row's state: Share / Dismiss / Mark resolved / Delete. Toolbar has a global enable/disable toggle and Clear history.

Detection coverage was cross-validated against every GitHub issue with log output (15 bug reports): 12 of 12 regex-shaped bugs would have been caught, plus the controlled live-run test (deliberate `throw` in `fanatical.js` triggered via `/api/run-service`) end-to-end populated the banner and DB correctly. Six issues are behavioral / silent-failure bugs (e.g. "Epic missed 2 free games") that no stack-trace regex can catch — out of scope for this feature.

**Privacy posture:** nothing leaves your host without an explicit Share click. The Share button opens GitHub's `issues/new` with a pre-filled title and body; you see the body before submitting and can redact whatever you want. Set `DIAGNOSTICS_BANNER=0` to hard-disable at boot independent of any DB state.

## What's new in 2.7.7

**X-server readiness probe now actually probes X ([#41](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/41) follow-up).** The 2.7.3 fix polled for the X11 socket file at `/tmp/.X11-unix/X1` and called it ready when the file appeared. Turns out TurboVNC writes that socket *early* in init — sometimes before X is actually answering connections — so the wait could pass too soon. Sahibishere reported the same `Missing X server or $DISPLAY` errors still hitting on 2.7.6, with the failures happening 30+ minutes after boot. Upgraded the probe:

- Added `x11-utils` to the Dockerfile so `xdpyinfo` is available.
- Entrypoint now waits using `xdpyinfo -display :1` — that makes an actual X11 protocol connection and only succeeds when X is genuinely ready. Falls back to the old socket-file check on older images that don't have `xdpyinfo` yet (graceful upgrade path).
- When the 30-second wait expires without success, the entrypoint now dumps the last 30 lines of `/fgc/data/TurboVNC.log` and points at common causes (stale `/tmp/.X1-lock`, PUID mismatch on `/home/fgc/.vnc/`, insufficient `/dev/shm`, vncserver crash). Boot-time failure diagnosis no longer requires `docker exec` into the container.

Pull `ghcr.io/feldorn/free-games-claimer:latest` (or pin `v2.7.7`). If you still hit the error after the pull, the boot log will now tell you why.

## What's new in 2.7.6

**Fix NOTIFY split corrupting single URLs with whitespace ([#44](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/44)).** TwoPlayer's `mailto://user:PASSWORD WITH SPACES@gmail.com` URL got shredded into three garbage argv entries because the 2.6.8 fix for the multi-URL Telegram bug split `cfg.notify` on `/\s+/` — too aggressive. Spaces appear inside legitimate URLs (especially mailto passwords); newlines and commas don't.

Switched the split to `/[\n,]+/` with per-piece trim. Both still cover the original YAML-block multi-URL case (newlines) and the apprise comma-list idiom, but single-URL configs with spaces inside the URL now pass through intact. Verified on all three input shapes.

---

## What's new in 2.7.5

**Fix notification deep-links 404'ing on query strings.** User tapped a captcha push and got a download prompt instead of the panel. Root cause: the panel's root handler matched the URL with strict equality (`req.url === '/'`), so any deep-link with a query (`?focus=captcha`, `?login=gog`, `?batch=gog`) made `req.url === '/?focus=captcha'` fall through to the implicit 404. The 404 response carried no `Content-Type` header, so the browser treated it as a generic file and offered to save it.

Every notification deep-link we've shipped uses one of these query shapes — captcha alerts, stale-session login prompts, batch-redeem reminders — so every one of them has been silently 404'ing for anyone tapping them. Fix splits the query off `req.url` before the equality check; works identically for direct access and SWAG-proxied access.

Plus a small follow-on from earlier today (already on `main` since [f6c1ed8](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/commit/f6c1ed8)): **dedupe Stats-tab Recent Claims and KPI counts** by `(service, normalized-title)` so platform-variant Epic entries (iOS / Android / locale-stamped slugs) don't double-count. User saw Arranger and Teacup each twice in the Recent Claims list — that's gone now, and the `gamesThisWeek / gamesThisMonth / gamesAllTime` KPI counts reflect unique titles.

---

## What's new in 2.7.4

**Fix apprise priority — pass via URL query param, not the nonexistent `--priority` CLI flag ([#42](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/42)).** When the Lenovo notify-priority + captcha-priority features landed in 2.5.8 / 2.7.0, our `notify()` helper appended `--priority <level>` as an apprise CLI flag. **That flag doesn't exist** — apprise's CLI has never had a generic priority option. Priority is per-notifier and configured via URL query string. The bug was silent until apprise actually rejected the arg: JxPv2 hit it on apprise v1.10.0 with `Error: No such option: --priority` whenever a captcha notify fired (Lenovo notifies were probably failing too, just less visibly because Lenovo wakes are infrequent).

Notifies that used the default `normal` priority worked fine — the flag was only emitted for non-normal calls, which is why **Send test** and per-run summary notifications worked while captcha alerts failed.

Fix: when `opts.priority` is non-normal, append `?priority=<value>` to each NOTIFY URL before passing them as positional argv to apprise. URL-encoded; correctly uses `&` when the URL already has a query string. Apprise translates the generic level (low/moderate/normal/high/emergency) to whatever the notifier supports — Pushover honors high/emergency literally, ntfy maps to 1-5, Telegram silent flag, Discord ignores.

No user action needed — existing deployments stay correct without config changes. Captcha and Lenovo alerts will fire with the correct priority on the next image pull.

## What's new in 2.7.3

**Wait for TurboVNC X server before starting the panel ([#40](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/40), [#41](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/41)).** Two reports of `browserType.launchPersistentContext: Target page, context or browser has been closed` accompanied by Playwright's `Looks like you launched a headed browser without having a XServer running` message. Root cause: `/opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncserver` is non-blocking — it forks the X server and returns immediately. The panel was then exec'd before the X socket was actually live, and any auto-session-check (or RUN_ON_STARTUP claim chain) that fired in the next second or two raced the X-server initialisation and crashed.

Particularly common under systemd quadlet autostart on host reboot — the container races other services for I/O and the panel's first Chromium launch lands before TurboVNC has finished setting up `/tmp/.X11-unix/X1`. Both reporters saw their setup stabilise on its own after a manual restart, which is the classic shape of a startup race.

Fix: `docker-entrypoint.sh` now blocks for up to 30 seconds after invoking `vncserver`, polling for the X socket at `/tmp/.X11-unix/X1`. Once the socket appears (typically <2 seconds), the panel exec proceeds. If the socket never appears, a clear warning is printed pointing at `/fgc/data/TurboVNC.log` for diagnosis.

---

## What's new in 2.7.2

**Discoveries roll-up — performance + tab persistence + README callout.** Three small fixes from a single round of live testing.

- **Active tab survives iframe-bust + back.** Clicking a game on the Discoveries tab navigates the top window away; the browser-back button then reloads the panel from scratch. Previously the panel landed back on Sessions because the active-tab state was DOM-only. Initial fix (2.7.1.x intermediate) stashed the tab in the URL hash, but that didn't survive when the panel runs inside a dashboard iframe (Organizr / Homepage / etc.) — the iframe-bust navigates the top window away from the dashboard, browser-back returns to the dashboard URL with no visibility into the panel's hash. Switched to `localStorage` (per-origin, survives navigation cycles in both top-level and iframed contexts). The panel now reliably returns to the tab you came from.
- **Discoveries endpoint cached server-side.** `/api/discoveries` was re-fetching GamerPower + r/FreeGameFindings on every call (~800ms cold). On panel reload where localStorage restored the user to Discoveries, that synchronous fetch blocked first paint and made the page feel sluggish. Added a 5-minute in-memory cache; hit cost drops to <1ms. The Refresh button passes `?force=1` to bypass; mark/unmark POSTs also invalidate the cache so user actions take effect immediately.
- **README intro + Claimers-table callout for aggregator discovery.** The free-game-discovery story improved meaningfully in 2.6.x with the GamerPower + FGF integration, but the README still described the storefronts as if their own first-party feeds were the only source. Added one sentence to the intro and a one-paragraph callout under the Claimers table pointing readers at the live Discoveries view in `docs/PANEL.md`.

Also bundled into this version, originally pushed as small follow-up commits on top of 2.7.1:

- **Minimal noVNC `package.json` shim** baked into the Dockerfile so the connection no longer 404s on `/novnc/package.json` (noVNC's `ui.js` fetches it for the version label).
- **noVNC `mobile-web-app-capable` meta** added at build time in the Dockerfile alongside the existing `apple-mobile-web-app-capable` tag (the apple-only form is deprecated in Chrome).

---

## What's new in 2.7.1

**Settings UX overhaul, doc split, and update-check banner.** Three related polish items addressing usability and discoverability.

**Settings — grid alignment + section hierarchy + credential masking + cross-tab dirty indicator.** Every row is now a 3-column CSS grid (220px label · 1fr control · auto-width revert), so labels start at the same x-offset on every Settings sub-page — the eye no longer re-anchors when moving from Scheduler to Notifications to Advanced. Section headers bumped from 10px/0.08em to 12px/0.12em with a stronger divider rule so they visually dominate field labels. A small `● = field is overridden from default. Click Revert to restore.` legend appears at the top of each pane making the dot's meaning discoverable.

Apprise URL field is now masked by default with a **Reveal** toggle — the URL embeds bearer tokens (`pover://USER_KEY@APP_KEY`, `tgram://botid:chatid/`, etc.) that were leaking on every screen-share and screenshot. Sidebar tabs get a small yellow dirty-count badge when fields in another section have pending changes — easier to see at a glance which tabs have un-saved work.

**README split into `docs/`.** The README had grown to 1,100+ lines. New shape: a slim landing `README.md` (~110 lines: header, services tables, feature highlights, screenshots tour, quick-start, doc index) plus six topic-focused docs:

- [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) — Docker, Compose, bare-metal, non-root
- [docs/CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) — Env vars, notifications, scheduling
- [docs/PANEL.md](docs/PANEL.md) — Tour of all seven panel tabs + Settings reference
- [docs/AUTH.md](docs/AUTH.md) — Automatic login + cookie upload + captcha pause
- [docs/NETWORKING.md](docs/NETWORKING.md) — Reverse-proxy setups
- [docs/REFERENCE.md](docs/REFERENCE.md) — Bot detection, data storage, HTTP API, troubleshooting

Discoveries tab gets its own screenshot in `docs/PANEL.md`; Settings screenshot refreshed to show the new grid alignment + legend.

**Update-available banner ([#39](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/39)).** New panel header pill that appears when a newer release is published. Polls `api.github.com/repos/feldorn/free-games-claimer/releases/latest` (and falls back to `/tags?per_page=20` when no releases are published — the fork uses git tags, not GitHub Releases) every six hours; cached in `data/update-check.json` so reloads don't hammer GitHub. Clicking the pill opens the release notes. Manual `docker pull` + restart still required to actually apply the update — we deliberately do **not** call the host docker socket (would need it mounted into the container, a real security concern).

Set `UPDATE_CHECK=0` to disable for offline / air-gapped deployments.

---

## What's new in 2.7.0

**Discoveries tab v2 — storefront sub-tabs, filter bar, per-row actions, user-state persistence.** Built in response to the user trigger "I want to highlight what needs my attention" — the v1 single-list view forced you to scan every entry across both aggregators every time. Now:

- **Sub-tabs by storefront.** Each destination store (Epic / Steam / GOG / Itch.io / IndieGala / STOVE / Mobile / Console / VR / Prime / Ubisoft / Other) gets its own tab with a count badge. Empty tabs hide automatically so the nav stays compact. "All" is the firehose; per-store tabs filter to one destination. Tab order is by coverage state (auto → manual) so the most actionable storefronts surface first.
- **Storefront classification extended.** FGF title-prefix patterns now cover Itch.io, IndieGala, STOVE, Mobile (`[Android]`/`[iOS]`/`[Mobile]`), Console (`[PS4]`/`[Xbox]`/`[Switch]`), and VR (`[Oculus]`/`[Rift]`/`[Quest]`). GamerPower entries fall back to a title-parenthetical hint (`<Name> (IndieGala) Giveaway`) when their platforms field is just `PC` — caught from real-world data where Indiegala / Stove / Itch.io entries were all bucketed as Other.
- **Sticky filter bar.** Search by title (live), Min-price dropdown ($0 / $5 / $10 / $15 / $20 / $25; hides items below threshold when worth is known, leaves unknown-price items alone), Hide claimed (default on), Hide ignored / skipped (default on — SKIP-forecast items are treated as implicitly ignored). State persists in localStorage so it survives panel reloads.
- **Per-row actions.** Each row gets 🚫 Ignore and ✓ Mark claimed buttons; ↺ Undo reverses them. Marks persist server-side in `data/discoveries-state.json`, keyed by `${collectorKey}::${normalizedTitle}` so the same game discovered by both GamerPower and FGF dedupes to one state entry — marking one flips both immediately (optimistic update, then server roundtrip). State entries auto-prune 14 days after their mark date when the game has dropped out of all aggregator feeds, so the file stays bounded.
- **CLAIMED + SKIP forecasts.** AUTO items the user already has in their store DB get a blue CLAIMED badge (cross-references claim DBs by URL slug + Steam appId + edition-stripped title). Steam items below `STEAM_MIN_PRICE` get a red SKIP badge with the worth chip highlighted, so you can see exactly which setting caused the skip.
- **ReadComments routing.** FGF posts with `link_flair_css_class === 'ReadComments'` (random-key distributions on NVIDIA/IndieGala/etc.) now link to the Reddit thread instead of the redeem endpoint — the redeem page is useless without a key from the comments. Coverage label gets a hint pointing back at the store URL for once-you-have-a-key redemption.

Backend: new `/api/discoveries/mark` + `/api/discoveries/unmark` endpoints; `/api/discoveries` now folds user-state into every item and includes a stable `dedupKey` field.

**Captcha notification deep-links + configurable priority.** When Epic / GOG / AliExpress hits a captcha mid-claim, the push notification now includes the panel's `?focus=captcha` deep link — tapping it auto-opens the browser view on the active service so you can solve the slider/hCaptcha without hunting through tabs. Plus a new Settings → Notifications → Captcha priority field (env `CAPTCHA_NOTIFY_PRIORITY`, default `high`) so the alert breaks through Pushover's DnD / quiet hours — captcha iframes time out in minutes and a delayed-by-2-hours notification is useless.

## What's new in 2.6.9

**Fix stale Chromium profile locks after container restart ([#37](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/37)).** Lifeng77X reported AliExpress refusing to launch with:

> The profile appears to be in use by another Chromium process (PID) on another computer (HOSTNAME). Chromium has locked the profile so that it doesn't get corrupted.

Root cause is a Docker + persistent-volume + Chromium interaction. Chromium writes `SingletonLock` / `SingletonCookie` / `SingletonSocket` files in the user-data-dir on every launch and removes them on clean shutdown. Ungraceful exits (container kill, host reboot, OOM) leave the files behind. The kicker: `SingletonCookie` stores the *hostname* that launched Chromium, and Docker assigns a *new* auto-generated hostname every container recreation. So the leftover lock from a previous container looks like "another computer", and Chromium refuses to use the profile. Once present, the lock never clears on its own.

Fix: every `launchPersistentContext` call site now runs `cleanProfileLocks(dir)` first, which removes the three known lock files. Belt-and-suspenders: the panel also sweeps all known profile dirs at startup, so a fresh container boot recovers instantly. The app's existing runtime mutex (`browserBusy`) already prevents two Chromium processes from racing on the same profile dir, so deleting the locks is safe.

If you hit this on an existing deployment before pulling 2.6.9 you can also remove the files manually:
```bash
docker exec <container> sh -c 'rm -f /fgc/data/browser*/Singleton*'
docker restart <container>
```

---

## What's new in 2.6.8

**Fix multi-URL `NOTIFY` ([#35](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/35)).** When `NOTIFY` was configured as a multi-line YAML block (one URL per line — the standard pattern for multiple notifier endpoints), the helper passed the entire string as one positional argv to apprise. Older apprise releases parsed the embedded newlines forgivingly; apprise ≥ 1.10 treats the concatenated string as a single URL and rejects the second protocol — Telegram's colon-heavy URL shape (`tgram://bot_token:chat_id/`) trips on this first, so it looked like "Telegram is broken" while Discord on the first line still went through. Fix: split `cfg.notify` on whitespace before assembling argv, so each URL becomes its own positional argument and apprise sees them independently. Existing single-URL deployments (the common case) keep working identically.

KairuByte's reproduction in the issue ran on apprise v1.10.0 with a YAML `NOTIFY: |\n  discord://…\n  tgram://…` shape — that's exactly the case this fix resolves.

---

## What's new in 2.6.7

**Discoveries tab polish.** Two small follow-ups to the SKIP work in 2.6.6:

- **Uniform badge widths.** AUTO / SKIP / NOTIFY / MANUAL / CLAIMED ranged from 4 to 7 characters, so the title column landed at different x-offsets row to row. `min-width:68px` + `text-align:center` gives every badge the same horizontal footprint.
- **Cross-source price bridge.** SKIP forecasting was only working on GamerPower (the only aggregator that exposes a `worth` field). The same Steam giveaway in r/FreeGameFindings still showed AUTO because Reddit posts don't carry price metadata. Now: when GamerPower lists the same title, the FGF entry inherits the price by edition-stripped title match, and the SKIP forecast fires consistently across both sections. Worth chip also displays in both sections now (was previously only on the GamerPower side).

## What's new in 2.6.6

**Discoveries tab — SKIP badge for items your settings will filter out.** When a Steam giveaway shows AUTO in Discoveries but its price is below your `STEAM_MIN_PRICE` threshold, the next run will skip it. Now Discoveries forecasts that and shows a red **SKIP** badge instead, with the offending price highlighted in red in the meta line so the cause is obvious at a glance. Tooltip on the badge explains exactly why ("Your Steam minimum price is $10 — this is $4.99…") with a hint at how to override (lower the threshold in Settings → Services → Steam, or claim manually via the link).

Currently forecasts Steam's price skip (visible in GamerPower's `worth` field). Steam's rating skip can't be forecast from aggregator data — only the live Steam page exposes review counts, and pre-fetching every Steam page would slow Discoveries down — so rating skips still show as AUTO and reveal themselves at runtime. Sort order updated to MANUAL → NOTIFY → SKIP → AUTO → CLAIMED so configured-to-skip items group near the other actionable states.

## What's new in 2.6.5

**Discoveries tab — CLAIMED badge for items already in your library.** The AUTO badge now means "will be auto-claimed on the next run if not already" — items that *are* already in your library get a separate **CLAIMED** badge (blue) so you can tell at a glance what still needs doing vs what's been handled. Cross-references each aggregator entry against the per-store claim DBs (`data/epic-games.json`, `data/steam.json`) using URL slug + Steam appId for Epic / Steam FGF entries, and falls back to a normalised-title match for GamerPower entries (which don't expose a direct store URL).

Also reordered the in-section sort: **MANUAL → NOTIFY → AUTO → CLAIMED**, top-to-bottom. Manual items (the ones requiring user action — Itch.io, mobile-only when EG_MOBILE is off, etc.) now surface first; already-claimed items drop to the bottom as informational. Matches the typical workflow: you open Discoveries to find what to do, not to admire what's done.

## What's new in 2.6.4

**External-link mode setting — Discoveries / footer links honor iframe context (and an explicit override).** User reported Discoveries-tab links erroring out *after* the GamerPower CF fix: clicking through landed on the GamerPower page fine, but then clicking GamerPower's "Open Giveaway" button failed because the panel was running inside a reverse-proxy dashboard iframe and the new tab inherited iframe sandboxing that Epic / Steam refuse to render in. The site-card and Lenovo-drop links already had an iframe-aware click handler (`openSiteUrl`) that navigates the top window when iframed — but the Discoveries-tab links and the GitHub footer links were plain `target="_blank"` without it. Now they all use the same handler.

Plus a new Settings field — **Panel link → External link behavior** — with three modes:
- **Auto** (default) — auto-detect iframe context; break out via top-nav when embedded, new tab when top-level.
- **Same tab** — always navigate the top window (replaces the current page). Useful if you prefer same-tab navigation regardless of context.
- **New tab** — always force new-tab semantics (may fail in some embedded contexts; included for unusual setups).

Env var: `EXTERNAL_LINK_MODE`.

## What's new in 2.6.3

**Discoveries tab — fix Cloudflare-gated link errors + footer GitHub links.** User reported many Discoveries-tab links erroring out when opened in a new tab. Root cause: we were linking to GamerPower's `open_giveaway_url` field, which is the `/open/<slug>` redirect page — Cloudflare gates it aggressively and a cold browser tab without a CF session gets a 403 challenge instead of the giveaway content. GamerPower's API also exposes `gamerpower_url` (the public listing page for the same giveaway), which is clean 200 with no CF challenge. Switched to that. The user lands on the public page, reads the offer, and clicks GamerPower's own "Open Giveaway" button, which establishes the CF session correctly so the subsequent click works. r/FreeGameFindings links were already direct store URLs and unaffected.

**Compact footer links — Repo · Issues · Discussions.** Always-visible footer below all tabs gives users a direct way to interact with the project. Tooltip on Discussions calls out that new aggregator-source suggestions belong there. Took the simplest path (plain links to the existing GitHub spaces) over a submission form — no auth, no submission backend, no spam exposure.

---

## What's new in 2.6.2

**Discoveries tab — surface aggregator listings with clickable links.** When 2.6.0/2.6.1 added GamerPower and r/FreeGameFindings as supplementary sources, anything we couldn't auto-claim (iOS / Android giveaways with EG_MOBILE off, Itch.io games, STOVE, etc.) only existed as log lines — no in-panel way to act on them. The new **Discoveries** tab fetches both aggregators live on open and renders every active listing with a clickable store link plus a coverage badge: **AUTO** (green) for items we auto-claim, **NOTIFY** (yellow) for notify-only items like GOG, and **MANUAL** (purple) for everything else — Itch.io, Epic Mobile when EG_MOBILE is off, platforms without a collector. The user's case that triggered this: spotting an iOS-only Epic giveaway in the FGF feed and wanting to claim it via the App Store on their phone — now a direct link to `store.epicgames.com/p/…-ios-…` is one click away.

Items sort within each source by coverage state (auto first, then notify, then manual) so what needs attention surfaces at the top. Refresh button does a force-refetch; otherwise re-entering the tab uses the JS-memory cache. Per-source errors degrade independently — if GamerPower is having a bad day, the FGF section still renders.

Backend: new `/api/discoveries` endpoint that parallel-fetches both aggregators and classifies every entry against the same collector-pattern map the claim scripts use, so the badges always reflect the *actual* runtime behavior (toggle EG_MOBILE off and the iOS giveaways flip from AUTO to MANUAL on the next refresh — no code change).

## What's new in 2.6.1

**Second aggregator source: r/FreeGameFindings ([#33](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/33) follow-up).** DoSpamu pointed at three third-party aggregators when reporting the Devil's Island gap; 2.6.0 covered [gamerpower.com](https://www.gamerpower.com/), and 2.6.1 adds the [r/FreeGameFindings](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeGameFindings/) subreddit as the second source. The subreddit's posting rules enforce a structured `[Epic Games]`, `[Steam]`, `[GOG]`, `[Itch.io]`, `[STOVE]`, ... title prefix and a Reddit `link_flair_css_class` of `Expired` / `PreviouslyGiven` / `PSA` etc. that we use to drop stale and non-actionable posts cleanly.

Unlike GamerPower, Reddit posts link directly at the store URL — no Cloudflare-gated redirect step. That makes this aggregator both cheaper per entry (single HTTPS request, no patchright tab) and more reliable. The integration follows the same pattern as the GamerPower one: per-collector filter (Epic, Steam, GOG), URL validation against the collector's store domain, merge into the existing claim queue (Epic/Steam) or notify-only surface (GOG). The collectors' own dedupe logic (Epic `urls.includes`, Steam `knownIds`) catches the substantial overlap between the two aggregators silently.

Three subtle filter rules: (1) PSA megaposts that point back at the Reddit comments thread are skipped — selftext parsing them is Phase 2; the same games typically also show up as individual platform-tagged posts. (2) Cross-posts of Lenovo Key Drops giveaways (URL `gaming.lenovo.com`) are skipped because our Lenovo watcher already alerts on those — without this, every Lenovo drop would surface twice. (3) Posts older than 72h are skipped to keep the noise floor low.

Run log now shows two unhandled-platforms summaries (one per aggregator source) — e.g. `FreeGameFindings — platform tags without a collector/watcher: Itch.io (12), Amazon Prime (3), STOVE (2)` — covering "what to consider building next" from both sides.

Reddit identifies us as `free-games-claimer/2.6.1 (https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer)` per their User-Agent policy. Single request per collector per run; well under the unauthenticated 60 req/min cap.

---

## What's new in 2.6.0

**Supplementary discovery via gamerpower.com ([#33](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/33)).** Some free games slip past our first-party feeds — DoSpamu reported on 2026-05-14 that *Devil's Island* and *Lost in the Hole* were free on Epic but absent from Epic's own `freeGamesPromotions` API and the `/free-games` page's "Free Now" section (third-party launch promos that Epic routes through their store without flagging on the surfaces our collectors scrape). [GamerPower](https://www.gamerpower.com/) aggregates these. We now query their public API once per collector and merge results into the run.

Coverage: **Epic**, **Steam**, **GOG** (the three collectors that work cleanly today). For Epic and Steam, GamerPower entries get auto-claimed — we follow each `gamerpower.com/open/…` redirect inside the collector's already-authenticated patchright context to capture the canonical store URL, then run the normal claim path. For Steam specifically, only `store.steampowered.com/app/N` results are auto-queued (sub/community/etc. paths are too varied to claim safely). For GOG, the integration is **notify-only** — same juice/squeeze framing as the existing GOG catalog watch: GOG claim UIs are too varied to auto-claim without live promos to test against. Unresolved or non-claim-shape entries surface as manual-action items in the run summary with the GamerPower link, tagged as `action` so they trigger notifications under the `actions` notify level.

Also: each run now logs a one-line summary (from `epic-games.js`, which typically runs first) of GamerPower platforms we don't currently handle — e.g. `GamerPower — platforms without a collector/watcher: Itch.io (7), Android (2), iOS (2)`. Per the user's request: if a platform shows up consistently across weeks, that's a candidate for a new collector or watcher.

Behavior is best-effort. The GamerPower /open/ page sits behind a Cloudflare challenge — patchright usually passes it (real Chromium executing the challenge JS), but when resolution fails we fall back to surfacing the title + GamerPower URL as a manual action so nothing silently drops. Run-summary counts and dashboard counters update normally.

## What's new in 2.5.9

**Run-log header stamps the panel version.** The `=== Free Games Run — 2026-05-14 ===` header at the top of each run now reads `=== Free Games Run v2.5.9 — 2026-05-14 ===` (or whichever version is active). Visible in `docker logs`, in the Logs tab live view, and — since the header is captured in the persisted run record — also visible when browsing past runs via the Past Runs dropdown. Helps when triaging "did this behavior land before or after I upgraded" kinds of questions from a single log line.

---

## What's new in 2.5.8

**Lenovo Gaming — configurable notification priority.** A user missed a "drop is LIVE NOW" alert because their phone was in Do-Not-Disturb mode. Lenovo notifications were always firing at default (normal) priority, which respects DnD/quiet hours on Pushover and most other notifiers — exactly the wrong default for a time-critical "claim within minutes" alert. New per-service setting in **Settings → Services → Lenovo Gaming Key Drops → Notification priority** (env: `LENOVO_NOTIFY_PRIORITY`) with apprise's standard ladder: `low` / `moderate` / `normal` (default) / `high` (bypasses Pushover quiet hours) / `emergency` (requires acknowledgment on Pushover). Applies to all Lenovo notifications — new-drop discovery, 1h/5min/at-drop wakes, restock alerts. Default `normal` preserves existing-deploy behavior; users opt into higher priority via the dropdown.

Apprise translates the level to whatever the configured notifier supports — Pushover honors high/emergency literally, Telegram maps to the silent-notification flag, Discord ignores. Notifier-specific behavior is on the user to know.

Under the hood: `notify()` in `src/util.js` now accepts `opts.priority` and passes `--priority <value>` to apprise when set to anything non-`normal`. Other call sites (claim summaries, captcha pause, watcher alerts) continue to use default normal priority and are unaffected.

## What's new in 2.5.7

**Scheduler — fix LOOP-without-anchor drift across restarts ([#32](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/32)).** Found while diagnosing xh43k's "MS didn't run for 2 days" report: a deployment with `LOOP=86400` set but no `START_TIME` was supposed to mean "every 24 hours" but the bare-LOOP code path in `computeMainWakeMs` returned `LOOP * 1000` regardless of when the last run actually completed. That meant every panel restart (image pulls, host reboots, panel updates) reset the wake clock to "24 hours from now" and silently skipped days. Users restarting the container at intervals shorter than `LOOP` were watching their scheduler keep getting pushed forward without firing. Now persisted to `data/scheduler-state.json` on every scheduler-main close: a single `lastMainCompletedAt` ISO timestamp. On boot, `computeMainWakeMs` reads it and computes `wake = max(60s, lastMainCompletedAt + LOOP - now)` — past-due fires immediately, future sleeps the remainder. First-run-ever (no state file) falls back to the original sleep-from-now behavior so existing deployments don't suddenly fire on first upgrade. Independent of the TZ display fix in 2.5.6.

---

## What's new in 2.5.6

**Schedule tab — accurate display + countdown when browser TZ ≠ server TZ.** Spotted while viewing a CDT-server panel from an ET browser: the displayed "Next run: 07:30" was being misread as 07:30 ET when the scheduler will actually fire at 07:30 CDT (08:30 ET), and the live countdown was off by an hour because JavaScript parses naked `"YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss"` strings as browser-local. Two fixes: (a) state response now includes UTC-ISO timestamps (`nextScheduledRunIso`, `nextMainRunIso`, `nextMsRunIso`, `lastRun.atIso`) plus a `serverTimezone` field, so the panel can do accurate cross-TZ math; (b) the Schedule tab renders wall times in the *server's* TZ (matching the `START_TIME` the user actually configured and what `docker logs` shows) with a `(8:30 AM EDT your local)` annotation appended only when server TZ differs from browser TZ. Countdown now uses the UTC anchor so it's always correct regardless of which TZ the panel is viewed from. Same-TZ deployments see no visible change.

## What's new in 2.5.5

**Honest baseline on bot detection — what we will and won't chase.** Added a top-level [Bot detection — what works, what doesn't](README.md#bot-detection--what-works-what-doesnt) section to the README documenting three categories of detection failure: (A) UI workflow drift we routinely fix, (B) browser fingerprint scoring against signals that come from real hardware (WebGL renderer, audio context, font enumeration, TLS handshake) — architecturally outside what a containerized self-hosted tool can shim past, (C) account-level risk scoring that decays naturally over weeks. Per-store reality table sets concrete expectations: Prime / Epic / GOG / Steam / MS Rewards stay reliable; AliExpress is deprecated by the upstream platform itself and accepted as best-effort. Explicit "what we won't build and why" subsection covers chromedp sidecars, cloud BaaS, Android emulators, and whole-project Firefox migration. The last was PoC'd on a [separate experiment branch](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/tree/experiment/camoufox-poc) (see #28); one Tier 0 test on a real AliExpress account hit the same AWSC slider as patchright, suggesting the ceiling is account/hardware-bound rather than JS-injection-bound. The branch remains open for further volunteer testing but no production integration is planned.

**AliExpress reframed as deprecated channel, not as a bot-detection bug.** Subtitle on the AliExpress service entry now reads "Deprecated by AliExpress — web coin collection is being phased out in favor of the mobile app. Works for some accounts on a degradation curve." Service tables in the README append `**deprecated**` with a link to the Bot detection section. The script and toggle remain in place — some accounts still work — but the framing makes clear this is a sunset path, not a bug we're hunting. Background on upstream reality: [vogler/free-games-claimer#391](https://github.com/vogler/free-games-claimer/issues/391) (closed) confirms AliExpress moved coin collection to mobile-only as of December 2024.

## What's new in 2.5.4

**MS Rewards — bail out instead of retry-spamming when Chromium dies mid-run ([#32](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/32)).** When the underlying browser process was lost mid-run (user closed the Chromium window via VNC, OOM-killer, container restart, etc.), `microsoft.js`'s per-search retry loop kept logging `Target page, context or browser has been closed` for every search × every retry — 90+ identical error lines back-to-back instead of giving up. Now the retry loop classifies `target/browser/context closed` as a *fatal* error and `throw`s to the caller, so the desktop/mobile session block logs a clean single-line failure and the run-complete summary still emits. The user-facing behavior change is just "obvious clean failure in the log" rather than "wall of identical retry warnings."

---

## What's new in 2.5.3

**Run-Now picker modal ([#32](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/32)).** The main page's **Run Now** button now opens a picker modal listing all active services with checkboxes, grouped by category (Claimers / Point-coin collectors / Watchers). Defaults match the historical `CLAIM_CMD_MANUAL` behavior — everything checked except Microsoft Rewards (which adds ~30-45 min to the run because of the humanlike search pacing). User can opt MS in for this specific run, opt anything else out, or use the Select-all / Select-none shortcuts. Click outside or hit Esc to cancel.

Server-side: `POST /api/run-all` now accepts an optional `{ sites: [...] }` body. Backward compatible — no body still fires the historical "everything except MS" chain. With a `sites` body, the chain runs exactly the selected services and `runAllScripts` auto-applies `MS_SKIP_WINDOW=1` if Microsoft Rewards is among them, so a manual MS run doesn't sleep until tomorrow's window.

Surfaced the long-running-MS design as a UI control rather than a silent exclusion — the per-card Run buttons still work for one-off single-service runs, but Run-Now no longer requires per-card-clicking to fire a mixed subset including MS.

---

## What's new in 2.5.2

**Logs tab — fix empty body when returning to a past-log view.** If you selected a past run from the dropdown, then switched to another tab, then came back, the body went blank — `startLogsTabPoll` reset the body to a "Loading…" placeholder and then `pollLogsTab` early-returned in history mode without ever repopulating it. Now we re-fetch and re-render the past log entry whenever the dropdown selection is non-empty on tab re-entry, so the view honors the dropdown state. The dropdown selection is intentionally preserved across tab switches — to see live output from a run that started while you were away, click the dropdown and pick `Live (current run)`.

---

## What's new in 2.5.1

**Notification verbosity control ([#31](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/31)).** New `notifications.notifyLevel` setting (env `NOTIFY_LEVEL`, also editable in **Settings → Notifications → Verbosity**) with three values: `all` (default — current behavior), `actions` (silences per-run summary notifications when nothing in the run needed user attention; keeps everything else), `off` (silences all notifications globally — including captchas and login errors). Default `all` preserves existing-deploy behavior; users opt into quieter modes via the new dropdown. Six summary call sites tagged: per-run game-list summaries on Prime / Epic / GOG / Steam (auto-promoted to `action` if any game in the list has `failed` or `action` status — so failures still surface even under `actions` mode), MS Rewards points-earned summary, AliExpress coins-earned summary. Watchers (Humble, Fanatical, Ubisoft, Lenovo, GOG-catalog) and the captcha-pause helper continue to fire under `actions` mode since their notifications are by definition action-required ("new free game found" = "go claim it").

---

## What's new in 2.5.0

**Run-log persistence on the Logs tab ([#29](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/29)).** Each completed claim run now writes a full record to `data/runs.json` — start time, source (scheduler-main / scheduler-ms / panel / etc.), exit code, duration, the aggregate `[run]` summary counters per service, and the full ordered log buffer. The Logs tab gets a **Past runs** dropdown above the log view: `Live (current run)` keeps the existing tail-poll behaviour; selecting a past run swaps to read-only mode showing that run's lines with the same timestamp / type-color rendering. Dropdown auto-refreshes when a run completes so you don't need to reload to see the just-finished entry. Capped at `RUN_HISTORY_MAX` entries (default 200, editable via env or in **Settings → Advanced → Logs** — the cap is read dynamically at each persist so a save takes effect on the next run without a panel restart). New API endpoints: `GET /api/runs` for the summary list (no log payload — fast), `GET /api/runs/:at` for a single run's full record. Existing users have no history before this version; first scheduled or Run-Now after upgrade is the first entry. Storage: ~10 MB max at the default 200-entry cap, so no concern.

---

## What's new in 2.4.2

**Epic Games — fix login stall on new-device / new-IP sessions ([#28](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/28)).** Epic shows a "Is this the right account?" confirmation prompt between credentials-submitted and the redirect to the claim URL when the login is coming from a new device, IP, or browser fingerprint — a cold start in a fresh container hits this every time. Without an auto-click on the prompt, our flow waited for `URL_CLAIM` that never arrived (the prompt was blocking the redirect) and timed out, presenting as "captcha completed but login fails." Ported the prompt handler from [P-Adamiec/free-games-claimer](https://github.com/P-Adamiec/free-games-claimer) (commit e421633): fire-and-forget `waitForSelector('button#yes, button[aria-label="Yes, continue"]')` with a 30s timeout and a silent `catch`, so already-logged-in or non-prompted sessions see zero behavior change. Surfaced by @DoSpamu's report on issue #28 plus a side-by-side review of the two forks' epic-games.js / aliexpress.js / gog.js (the GOG and AliExpress comparisons surfaced no gaps — feldorn is strictly ahead on those).

## What's new in 2.4.1

`RUN_ON_STARTUP` lets the panel fire a claim run immediately after the boot session-check and (optionally) exit afterwards. Built for setups that wake the container on demand — [Sablier](https://github.com/SablierApp/sablier) scale-to-zero, host cron driving `docker start`/`docker stop`, ad-hoc `docker run --rm` — where keeping the panel up 24×7 wastes resources. Requested in [#27](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/27).

Three values:

- `0` — Off (default). No behavior change for existing deploys.
- `1` — Run on startup, panel keeps running. Pairs with Sablier-style traffic-based scaling.
- `2` — One-shot (run + exit). Container terminates cleanly after the run completes; cron / `docker run --rm` path.

Editable via env or **Settings → Schedule** as a dropdown. Picking `One-shot` in the UI shows a confirmation modal explaining the post-exit recovery paths (data/config.json wins over env, so env=0 alone won't revert a UI-saved one-shot) and warns when `NOTIFY` is empty. Boot logs print a headless-mode banner with inline disable instructions so anyone tailing logs sees the why and how-to-stop, and an exit banner repeats the same hints right before `process.exit(0)`. Notifications drain on a 1.5s settle before exit. Mode 1 fires the manual chain (`CLAIM_CMD_MANUAL` — claimers + watchers, microsoft.js excluded) so the still-running MS scheduler can handle MS at its proper window without double-running. Mode 2 fires the full chain (`CLAIM_CMD` including `microsoft.js`) with `MS_SKIP_WINDOW=1` so MS runs before the container exits. Both modes pass `NOWAIT=1` so stale sessions fail fast.

**Richer end-of-run notifications for Microsoft Rewards and AliExpress.** Instead of `microsoft-rewards: completed desktop and mobile reward sessions.`, the MS notification now reads `Microsoft Rewards: +120 desktop, +90 mobile, balance 11,540 pts` — falls back gracefully when one or both sessions failed login, with a final fallback to a "no points data captured" line if neither session produced a balance read. AliExpress (which previously sent no notification at all) now emits `AliExpress: +20 coins, balance 480, 14-day streak (+30 tomorrow)` after each daily check-in run, matching the same shape; suppressed when the run produced no data so a notification with no numbers in it isn't sent.

**One-shot UI banner.** When `RUN_ON_STARTUP=2` is the effective config the panel renders an amber banner on every tab — "One-shot mode active — container will exit after the next claim run" — with a sub-line explaining how to revert. Switches to "claim run in progress, container will exit when it finishes" while a startup run is running, so the user sees the impending exit clearly before navigating away or starting something that depends on the panel staying up.

**README warning on restart-policy + mode 2.** The shipped compose template uses `restart: unless-stopped`, which would form an infinite restart loop with mode 2 (exit → docker restarts → run → exit → repeat). Documented in the new Run-on-startup subsection: set `restart: no` (or remove the line) for mode 2 and let the orchestrator own the lifecycle. Mode 1 is unaffected.

## What's new in 2.4

New collector: **Lenovo Gaming Key Drops** (watch-only, Phase 1 of a planned auto-claim build-out).

Lenovo runs scheduled key-drops at `gaming.lenovo.com/game-key-drops` — first-come-first-served once they go live, often exhausted within minutes. The default daily-poll watcher pattern (Humble, Fanatical, Ubisoft) doesn't fit: a drop scheduled for 11am could be over before the next morning's watcher run picks it up. Phase 1 builds the schedule-aware infrastructure to land that first round of usefulness — Phase 2 will layer auto-claim + GamesPlanet voucher redemption on top.

What ships:

- **Watcher script (`lenovo-gaming.js`)** — fetches the listing, parses each drop (status from title prefix, region, restock flag), and for new/changed drops descends into the embedded TickCounter widget on the detail page to extract the absolute scheduled datetime. Treats the widget's wall-clock as Eastern Time, converts to UTC via `Intl.DateTimeFormat` round-trip (handles DST automatically), and stores in `data/lenovo-gaming-watch.json`. Diffs against the previous cycle and fires push notifications on: new drop discovered, status transition (coming-soon → active), and restock detection.
- **Per-drop scheduler loop (`lenovoSchedulerLoop`)** — reads the watch JSON, computes pending wakes (1h before / 5min before / at drop-time per upcoming drop), sleeps until the nearest, fires the appropriate push notification, and stamps the per-notification timestamp so the same wake doesn't re-fire on next loop. `fs.watch` on the state file fires scheduler wakeups when the watcher updates it (new drops, collected toggles, etc.) so the next-wake recomputes immediately. Past-target wakes (system was suspended, container restarted) get marked sent without notifying — the user already knows the drop happened. Mirrors the existing main + MS Rewards scheduler pattern.
- **Sessions card UI** — the Lenovo watcher card lists user-actionable drops inline with status pill (Live now / Restocked / Coming soon), title, scheduled time + countdown, "Got it" button, and ↗ open-link. Clicking "Got it" sets `userCollected` on the drop and suppresses subsequent pre-claim wakes for that drop (restock notifications continue, since a restock = new key pool).
- **API endpoint** — `POST /api/lenovo/drops/:id/collected` toggles the collected flag.
- **Activation** — opt-in via `LENOVO_ACTIVE=1` env or Settings → Services. First run establishes a baseline (no notification spam); subsequent runs notify on changes.
- **Engine bump 2.3.x → 2.4.0** marking the new collector + scheduler loop addition.

What's deferred to Phase 2:

- Auto-claim of vouchers from Lenovo (requires login + queue-handling + per-drop UI variation)
- GamesPlanet voucher redemption (requires a second login + per-voucher form submission)
- Steam-key forwarding into the existing batch redeemer

## What's new in 2.3.19

- **Prime Gaming summary `skipped` count is no longer hardcoded 0**. The Prime claim loop has three pre-claim bailouts (`PG_TIMELEFT` filter, `DRYRUN` mode, `INTERACTIVE` confirm-cancel) that `continue`d without incrementing any counter; the summary call hardcoded `skipped: 0`. Result: runs with those flags active silently dropped skipped games from the summary. Added a `skippedCount` counter, incremented at each of the three bailout sites (across the main claim loop, the external-store loop, and the DLC loop), and wired it into the `log.summary` call. No-op for default-mode users (none of those bailouts fire by default); accurate for users with the flags set.

---

## What's new in 2.3.18

- **Epic run summary now includes DB-fast-path titles in the already-owned count**. When epic-games.js sees a title's claim DB entry already marked `claimed` (claimed in a prior run), it `continue`s past the full claim flow — but didn't push to `notify_games`, so the run summary's `uniqueByTitle('existed')` count missed those titles. Result: a run where every title was already in library showed "1 already owned" in the summary even when the body listed three titles all logged as already-claimed/already-owned. Fixed by pushing `{ status: 'existed' }` to `notify_games` from the early-bailout path so the summary count matches the body.

---

## What's new in 2.3.17

- **AliExpress coin balance parser handles the new response shape** ([#22](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/22)). KairuByte's runs reported `Summary: 0 claimed, 0 skipped, 0 coins` regardless of their actual balance. The `pre_auth.coins` listener was only handling the old name/value array response shape (`d.data.data: [{ name: 'userCoinsNum', value: '1234' }, ...]`). AliExpress shifted some regions to a direct-object shape (`d.data.data: { userCoinsNum: 1234, ... }`) which the parser silently dropped to null. Extended to handle both shapes, plus added a debug dump of the actual response when extraction still produces null — so the next mutation surfaces in the run log instead of disappearing. Also fixed an edge case where a real-zero balance would coerce to null via `Number(0) || null`. AliExpress collector bumped to v2.3.

## What's new in 2.3.16

- **Epic claim flow no longer waits 60s per game** ([#21](https://github.com/feldorn/games-claimer/issues/21), [#23](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/23) follow-up). 2.3.15's regex selector for the success modal still missed for some users — the modal would render visibly but `text=/Thanks for your order|It.s all yours/i` wouldn't match (likely the heading text is split across multiple span children, or curly-quote rendering differs). The CTA-fallback path correctly recovered claims as `claimed` via the post-click CTA check, but each game still burned the full 60s timeout before falling through. Replaced the single `waitFor` call with a `Promise.race` of three signals: the modal-text regex (kept as a fast-path), the modal's "Continue browsing"/"Download launcher" button selectors (more stable per-popup identifiers), and a `waitForFunction` that polls the page CTA for "In Library" (ground-truth success state). Whichever fires first wins. Steady-state per-claim wait drops from 60s to ~1-2s.

---

## What's new in 2.3.15

- **Epic Games claim detection: handle the new "It's all yours" success popup** ([#21](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/21), [#23](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/23)). Epic refreshed their post-purchase confirmation in 2026 — heading changed from "Thanks for your order!" to "It's all yours" with the older phrase relegated to subtitle text. The script's `text=Thanks for your order!` selector stopped matching → claim flow logged as failed → fallback CTA-check found the game in library and reported it as "already in library." Result: every Epic claim today logged as `existed` instead of `claimed`. Fixed by switching to a regex selector that matches either phrasing (`text=/Thanks for your order|It.s all yours/i`). Also reclassified the post-failure CTA-check fallback path: if the CTA reads "In Library" after this run's Get-button click, log as `claimed` (the in-library state IS the result of our click), not `existed`. Epic collector bumped to v2.1.
- **`NOVNC_URL` env var to override the noVNC iframe URL** ([#20](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/20)). Reverse-proxy users with split subdomains (e.g. `getgames.example.com` for the panel and `getgamesbrowser.example.com` for noVNC) couldn't make the embedded browser view work because the panel hardcoded the iframe URL to `<panel-host>:6080`. Set `NOVNC_URL=https://browser.example.com` (or whatever path serves your noVNC root) and the panel uses that verbatim — both for the embedded iframe and the "Pop out ↗" new-tab button. Falls through to the existing port-suffix construction when unset, so direct-access deployments are unchanged.

---

## What's new in 2.3.14

Panel polling cleanup ([#17](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/17)).

- **Pending-redeem counts folded into `/api/state`**. The panel's 10-second background poll previously fired three sequential requests per tick (`/api/state` + `/api/pending-gog-count` + `/api/pending-steam-count`). Counts are cheap to compute (one small JSON read each) and now ride along with state, so the steady-state load drops from 3 requests per cycle to 1. Standalone `/api/pending-gog-count` and `/api/pending-steam-count` endpoints remain for one-off post-redeem refreshes.
- **Polling pauses when the tab is hidden** (Page Visibility API). When you switch away from the panel's browser tab, the poll loop stops entirely — zero requests until you switch back. Re-focusing the tab triggers an immediate refresh so the view is never stale, then the regular 10-second cadence resumes.

Combined effect: a backgrounded panel now generates **zero** background traffic, and a foregrounded panel generates **one-third** of the previous traffic. Bandwidth was always negligible, but the DevTools-network noise is gone.

---

## What's new in 2.3.13

- **Sessions card "↗" icon: handle iframed-panel + cross-origin-isolated destinations**. Sites like Epic Games, Microsoft Rewards, and Steam all send strict cross-origin isolation headers (`Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin`, `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`, `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`). When the panel is iframed inside Organizr (or any sandboxed iframe), Chromium's interaction between iframe sandbox flags and cross-origin isolation requirements blocks `target="_blank"` navigation to those destinations with `ERR_BLOCKED_BY_RESPONSE` — even with the `allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox` token. Added an `onclick` handler that detects iframe context and uses `window.top.location.href` to navigate the top browsing context instead, escaping the iframe entirely. Top-level panel users still get new-tab behaviour as before. Middle-click on the icon also still produces a new tab via the browser's native mechanism. GOG and Ubisoft (which don't set the strict isolation headers) work either way; this fix specifically unblocks the strict-isolation set.

---

## What's new in 2.3.12

- **Sessions card "open in new tab" icon now works inside Organizr's iframe**. The 2.3.11 attempt (`window.open(url, '_blank', 'noopener')`) still failed with `ERR_BLOCKED_BY_RESPONSE` when the panel was iframed inside Organizr — turns out the `noopener` feature interacts badly with iframe sandbox restrictions on cross-origin top-level navigation. Reverted to a plain `<a target="_blank">` anchor with no `rel` attribute, which matches what Organizr's own bookmarks plugin uses (and works in the same sandbox context). Modern browsers (Chrome 88+, Firefox 79+, Safari 12.1+) default `target=_blank` to noopener for cross-origin links anyway, so dropping the `rel` attribute doesn't lose security.

---

## What's new in 2.3.11

- **Sessions card "open in new tab" icon now uses `window.open` instead of `<a target="_blank">`**. Reverse proxies that inject `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` (a SWAG default in some configs) can cause Chromium to block cross-origin top-level anchor navigations with `ERR_BLOCKED_BY_RESPONSE` — even for benign destinations like google.com. Switched to a `<button>` that calls `window.open(url, '_blank', 'noopener')` from a click handler; this opens a fresh top-level browsing context and bypasses the policy enforcement that was blocking the anchor flow.

---

## What's new in 2.3.10

- **Microsoft Rewards: claim pending bonus points before they expire**. The dashboard shows a separate banner at the top — `Claim your N bonus points before they start expiring on <date>` with its own Claim button — distinct from the daily activity cards. The script's existing `mee-card:has(.mee-icon-AddMedium)` selector only matched the activity cards, missing the banner entirely. Result: bonus points sat unclaimed until they actually expired. Added `claimPendingBonusPoints()` that locates the `<mee-rewards-pointclaim-banner>` element and clicks its Claim button; runs in both desktop and mobile session blocks after the activity cards. No-op when the banner isn't present (most days). Microsoft collectors bumped to v2.1.
- **"Open in new tab" icon on Sessions and Watcher cards**. Each card's header now has a small `↗` link next to the existing `↻` reset-login icon. Click to open the relevant site in a new tab — useful for checking your account state outside the panel (e.g. seeing your MS Rewards balance, browsing Epic's free-games page). Per-site target picks `homeUrl ?? loginUrl`; Steam and Epic got explicit `homeUrl` registry fields so the link goes to the store landing page instead of the login form. Watchers (Ubisoft, Humble, Fanatical) got `homeUrl` populated to their respective free-items pages.

---

## What's new in 2.3.9

Two reports from #15/#16:

- **Healthcheck no longer 401s when `PANEL_PASSWORD` is set** ([#16](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/16)). The Docker `HEALTHCHECK` previously hit `/api/state`, which is gated by the panel-auth middleware — once a password was set, the check returned 401 and orchestrators (TrueNAS, Portainer, etc.) marked the container unhealthy even though the panel was fine. Added a dedicated unauthenticated `/api/health` endpoint that returns `{"ok":true}` and pointed the Dockerfile healthcheck at it. No state is exposed beyond "the process is alive".
- **Microsoft card-fail diagnostic dumps moved to a subfolder** ([#15](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/15)). When the Bing-rewards card-click retry fails, the script saves a screenshot + page HTML for later debugging. Those previously landed at `data/ms-card-fail-*.png` / `*.html` next to the per-service JSON DBs, cluttering the data folder. Now writes to `data/diagnostics/microsoft/` (auto-created on first failure).

---

## What's new in 2.3.8

Polish on the 2.3.7 log refactor.

- **Epic dedupes summary counts by title** — the body lines were already deduped (one row per unique title even when Epic returns each game twice for PC + Mobile), but the summary count was still adding up the variants. So the body would list 4 owned games and the summary would say "6 already owned". Both numbers now agree on the unique-title count.
- **Visual gap between service blocks** — runner injects a blank runLog entry above each `───` section header so per-service blocks read as discrete chunks in the panel's Logs tab.
- **No more timestamp jam against `───` / `===`** — section headers and run delimiters render without the per-line `HH:MM:SS` prefix (panel renderer skips the time span entirely when `l.time` is null). Plus a hard space added after the time span on regular lines so even copy-pasted plaintext keeps timestamps visually separated from content (CSS margins don't survive copy-paste).
- **Humble Bundle and Fanatical drop their own name from their own field labels** — `Humble API responses captured: 20` → `API responses captured: 20`, `Free Fanatical products on page: 0` → `Free products on page: 0`. The section header already says which service is running.

---

## What's new in 2.3.7

Run log second pass — strict consistency, less noise.

- **One marker per service instead of two**: collapsed `[RUN-SUMMARY]` + `[RUN-SUCCESS]` into a single `[run] service=<id> ok claimed=N skipped=N <key>=<v> …` line. The `ok` token is the success signal; metrics ride along. Three lines saying the same thing → two (`summary:` for humans, `[run]` for the runner).
- **Strict 3-field summary shape**: every service now emits exactly `summary: <claimed> claimed, <skipped> skipped, <n> <context>` — same column layout, scannable vertically. Service-specific metrics still ride in the `[run]` marker but stop crowding the human line. Watchers always show `0 claimed, 0 skipped` for consistency. Per-service third field: GOG `tracked`, Prime/Epic/Steam `already owned`, Ubisoft/Humble/Fanatical `on page`, Microsoft `points earned`, AliExpress `coins`.
- **Date header / run-complete footer no longer get timestamp-prefixed in the panel**. The header (`=== Free Games Run — 2026-05-06 ===`) is meant as a visual delimiter, not another data row; the runner pushes its `runLog` entry with `time: null` so the Logs tab renders without a `HH:MM:SS` column.
- **Removed the `Scripts finished with exit code N` line** that immediately followed the run-complete footer. The footer already carries the exit code.
- **Run-complete footer always shows `claimed`** (even at 0) so users can scan vertically across days for the headline number.
- **Removed all closing `─────` rulers** at end of service blocks — they were inconsistent (claim scripts had them, watchers didn't) and the leading blank line in `log.section` is enough delimiter. `log.sectionEnd` helper deleted.
- **Steam's `Source:` line dropped** — informational only, didn't pull weight against the consistency cost.

---

## What's new in 2.3.6

Run log readability pass.

- **Run header** at the start of each claim run: `=== Free Games Run — YYYY-MM-DD ===`. Makes it cheap to scroll back through `docker logs` and find a specific day.
- **Run footer** at the end: `=== Run complete: 7 services, 1 claimed, 2 skipped, 142 points earned, exit 0 ===`. Aggregated from per-service markers so it always reflects what actually happened.
- **Universal per-service summary** — every service now ends its block with a one-line `summary: …` (claim services: claimed/skipped/failed/needs manual redeem/already owned; watchers: tracked/new; Microsoft: points earned). Previously only Steam reliably emitted one. Drives the run footer too.
- **Drop redundant `Time:` lines** from each section. The runner already prefixes every log line with HH:MM:SS, so the second timestamp added nothing.
- **`•` glyph for already-owned games** (`log.owned()` helper) — distinguishes "no work needed" from "new action this run" (`✓` via `log.ok`). Applied on Epic and Steam already-in-library messages and GOG already-claimed messages.
- **Epic dedups platform-variant noise** — Epic's API returns each free game twice (PC + Mobile), and the script processed both. The "already in library" log line now appears once per title instead of repeating per platform; per-variant DB state is still updated.

`[RUN-SUMMARY]` markers are emitted alongside `[RUN-SUCCESS]` (parser-friendly key=value shape) so the runner aggregates without scraping human-readable text.

---

## What's new in 2.3.5

- **Sessions cards show last successful run** — replaced the ambiguous `(HH:MM:SS)` session-check suffix with a meaningful "Last Successful Run YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" line. Each service script emits a `[RUN-SUCCESS] service=<id>` marker via `process.on('exit')` only on clean exit; the runner parses these from stdout and persists per-site completion timestamps to `data/last-runs.json`. Microsoft Rewards is split per-session (microsoft + microsoft-mobile), so each card shows its own last-success time independently. Cards with no recorded run (fresh install) just show the login status without the second sentence.

---

## What's new in 2.3.4

GOG username detection regression fix + DB cleanup ([#9](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/9)), plus a small Settings UX tweak.

- **Cookie / profile-link fallback now actually fires when DOM returns a nav label**. The 2.3 (`0665aeb`) fix added "Reviews" to the nav-label guard so it stopped showing as the username, but a latent ordering bug meant the cookie/profile fallback was *before* the guard. So when DOM returned "Reviews", the fallback was skipped (`user` was truthy), the guard then discarded "Reviews", and the script fell straight to the email-prefix last-resort — surfacing as e.g. `User: 2chrisorr` instead of `User: feldorn`. Restructured detection: each source (DOM text, DOM title, cookie/profile-link, email-prefix) is independently run through `cleanCandidate`, cascading until one returns a valid name.
- **One-time DB cleanup**: prior versions of the detection bug fragmented one user's claim history across multiple buckets (`Reviews`, `Games 0`, `Games\n                0`, `unknown`). On next run, gog.js merges any unambiguously-bad legacy username keys into the canonical bucket and deletes the source keys. Idempotent — once merged, subsequent runs find nothing to migrate. Email-prefix-shaped legacy keys are *not* auto-merged (could be a real second account); manual cleanup if needed.
- GOG collector bumped to v2.2.
- **Settings save/discard footer pinned to viewport bottom**. Previously, when the panel grew taller than viewport (iPad / narrow windows), the save bar scrolled off-screen and users had to scroll to find it. `position: sticky; bottom: 0` + a subtle drop shadow makes it always reachable; no-op on desktop where the layout already fits.

---

## What's new in 2.3.3

AliExpress post-collect false-positive fix ([#2](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/2)).

- **Recognise "already collected today" as logged-in** — both `aliexpress.js` auth() and the panel's `checkLogin` raced two markers: `button:has-text("Log in")` (logged out) vs `h3:text-is("day streak")` (logged in). When the user had already collected today's coins (manually on another device, or on an earlier run), the streak h3 disappears and the page shows "Earn more coins" — neither marker visible, so both code paths false-failed with "AliExpress page never finished loading" or "Login not detected". Added `button:has-text("Earn more coins")` as a third logged-in signal in both spots. Surfaced by dabziuebu4egh2 in #2 after their cookie-upload login worked at the API level (coin balance returned correctly) but the DOM check still failed. AliExpress collector bumped to v2.2.

---

## What's new in 2.3.2

Prime Gaming pending-redeem age filter ([#14](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/14)).

- **Hide stale pending entries** — Settings → Per-Store → Prime Gaming → "Hide pending manual-redeem entries older than N days" (env: `PG_PENDING_MAX_AGE_DAYS`). Filters the per-run notification only; DB entries are preserved so flipping the value off restores them. Default unset = old behavior, every pending entry always shown. Designed for the Microsoft Store / Xbox tail where there's no automated library reconciliation: codes that were either redeemed long ago or have since expired stop spamming the daily notification once you set a sensible cutoff (180 days is a reasonable starting point).

---

## What's new in 2.3.1

Anti-detection hardening (Layers 1+2 of the [#2](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/2) plan).

- **Viewport unification** — the panel's session-status check (`checkSiteStatus`) now uses the configured `cfg.width × cfg.height` instead of a hardcoded 1280×720. Sites whose `contextOptions` set their own viewport (AliExpress's Pixel 7 device profile) still win for that site; everywhere else the launch viewport matches the claim-run viewport so the bot-scoring "device dimensions changed between sessions" signal goes quiet.
- **AliExpress fingerprint persistence** — `src/util.js#getOrCreateFingerprint` saves the generated UA + headers to `<profileDir>/.fgc-fingerprint.json` on first run and reloads them on every subsequent run. Sites that already use `fingerprint-injector` (currently only AliExpress) now stop emitting a fresh device-id each launch, which is itself a flag in some bot-scoring systems. AliExpress collector bumped to v2.1; other sites unchanged this release.

---

## What's new in 2.3

Cookie upload on the Sessions dashboard.

- **Cookie upload** — paste an EditThisCookie / Cookie-Editor JSON export into a per-site card and the panel writes it to that site's persistent profile, then re-runs `checkSiteStatus` to confirm the session took. Uses the same mutex that gates Login / Check / Run so it can't race a concurrent claim. Validation rejects malformed payloads before they touch the profile dir.
- **Status-driven login button** — the Sessions card now shows **Login** when the site is not authenticated and **Check** when it is, instead of two buttons that look the same. A small bare ↻ icon in the card header re-runs Login on demand even when the session is healthy (rare, but useful for forced re-auth before suspected bans).
- **Change-accounts confirm modal** — clicking ↻ on a logged-in card now prompts before nuking the existing profile, so a stray click can't lose a working session.

---

## What's new in 2.2

First two collectors built on the new framework, plus Settings/Sessions polish.

- **Humble Bundle (watch-only, opt-in)** — pings you when a new free item appears in the Humble store. Uses Patchright + response interception to bypass Cloudflare's bot management, captures the `/api/all-promotions/en` response, filters to the no-spend tier, diffs against `data/humble-bundle-watch.json`, and sends an apprise notification on new items. No login, no auto-claim — Humble's claim flow varies enough across promo formats (community freebie vs Choice unlock vs Trove drop) that watch-only is the cheaper-to-maintain default. v0.1 — selectors and the URL strategy may need iteration as Humble updates their store layout. Enable in **Settings → Per-service → Humble Bundle**.
- **Fanatical (watch-only, opt-in)** — pings you when a new free Steam-key giveaway appears at fanatical.com/en/free-games-keys. Same Playwright + response-interception pattern, hits Fanatical's `/api/all-promotions/en` endpoint, walks `freeProducts[*].products[*].freegames[*]` for items at min_spend $0, filters to `type === 'game'` so comic and book freebies don't spam notifications. Enable in **Settings → Per-service → Fanatical**.
- **Three-way Services grouping** — Settings → Services now splits into Game Collectors (Prime, Epic, GOG, Steam), Point Collectors (Microsoft Rewards, AliExpress), and Notify-Only Collectors (Ubisoft, Humble Bundle, Fanatical). Data-driven from the registry: `claimDbFile` presence + `scheduleKind` decide which group an entry lands in. Headers render as small uppercased labels with subtle separators.
- **Watchers section on Sessions tab** — active watch-only collectors get their own compact card row between the main session grid and the Available drawer. Run-button-only (no Login, no Check). Hidden when no watchers are active or the sessions area is collapsed. Inactive watchers stay surfaced in Settings → Services rather than this tab.
- **Unsaved-changes guard** — toggle a setting and try to navigate away without saving, and a centered modal asks: Stay on Settings / Discard and continue / Save and continue. Backdrop click and Escape both behave as Stay. If Save is chosen and the request fails, the user is held on Settings rather than losing changes silently. Page close and reload trigger the browser's native beforeunload dialog.
- **Post-save state refresh** — saving Settings now refreshes the in-memory state object so the Sessions card grid, Watchers section, and Available drawer reconcile immediately rather than waiting for the next 10-second poll. Schedule and Stats tabs read the same fresh state on next entry.

---

## What's new in 2.1

Engine refactor. Same user-facing tool, much cleaner internals — adding a new collector no longer means hand-edits across the panel HTML, the scheduler dispatch, the config schema, the active-services enum, and the stats DB list.

- **Sites registry framework** — Phase 0 of [issue #11](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/11). `src/sites.js` is the new declarative source of truth for every service the engine knows about. Each registry entry carries its own metadata (id, name, version, schedule kind, claim DB filename, configFields, etc.). `CONFIG_SCHEMA`, the scheduler chain, the stats DB list, the active-services enum, and the Settings → Services rendering are all derived from the registry at boot. Adding a new collector now requires one entry in `src/sites.js` plus the per-site `<id>.js` runner — zero engine touches for normal cases.
- **"Adding a new collector" guide** — [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-new-collector) covers the registry entry fields, configFields shape, coerce descriptor kinds, runner contract, claim DB entry shape, and a smoke checklist. Spec for adding a site without touching the engine.
- **Steam batch redemption** — parallel to the existing GOG batch redeem flow. Scans every claim DB for entries with `store: 'steampowered.com'` and a `code`, drives Steam's `account/registerkey` page programmatically, classifies responses into redeemed / already-owned / used-elsewhere / invalid / region-locked / rate-limited buckets, and writes status back to the source DB. Surfaces in the panel as a separate "Batch Redeem on Steam" button alongside GOG's. Halts on rate-limit so a long batch can't burn through more keys after Steam starts blocking.
- **Per-site versioning** — every registry entry carries a `version` string (existing services baselined at `2.0`; brand-new collectors start lower per their maturity). Surfaces in the Sessions tab cards (small subdued `vN.N` upper-right) and Settings → Services rows (next to the settings count). The contributor bumps it as their script evolves.
- **Branch-tagged Docker builds** — `feat/*`, `fix/*`, `refactor/*`, and `dev` branches now produce `:<branch-name>` images via the existing GHA workflow, with `concurrency: cancel-in-progress` so rapid pushes don't race the moving tag. `:latest` stays gated to `main` only.

---

## What's new in 2.0

Major refactor of the control panel and configuration story.

- **Five-tab workspace** — Sessions / Stats / Schedule / Logs / Settings. Header auto-collapses to a single compact status strip once setup is done, freeing the main area for the noVNC browser or the current run's log.
- **Settings tab** — every runtime flag that `src/config.js` reads is editable in-app. Docker env becomes the *initial default*; in-app saves take priority. Scheduler changes take effect immediately via `fs.watch`, no container restart needed.
- **Stats tab** — claim history derived from the existing per-service JSON DBs. KPI tiles (this week / month / all-time / last claim / MS points balance / MS points this week), per-service table, 30-day activity chart, recent-claims list with deep links to the stores.
- **Schedule tab** — next-run wall time with live countdown, human-readable interval (e.g. "Daily, anchored to MS window start 08:00 local time"), last-run summary with status.
- **Logs tab** — scrollable run-log viewer that polls independently of the Sessions tab so the main noVNC area stays clear.
- **Microsoft Rewards points tracking** — `microsoft.js` scrapes the Rewards counter before and after each desktop/mobile session. Deltas land in `data/microsoft-rewards.json` and feed the Stats tab's points KPIs.
- **Username capture fixes** — GOG reads `menu.gog.com/v1/account/basic` directly (no more "Logged in as unknown"); Microsoft reads the ME Control widget in the header.
- **Prime DLC graceful no-op** — Amazon removed the in-game content tab in 2026; the claim script now probes for it and skips in <1s instead of hanging for 60s on a missing selector.
- **Cache-Control: no-store** on panel HTML so iPad Safari and other aggressive caches can't serve stale inline JS after a push.

Existing users: pull the new image, open the **Settings** tab, and everything you had set via docker env is already there as a fallback. Edit anything you want to change at runtime — the docker-compose file only needs to change for things that stay env-only (ports, `PANEL_PASSWORD`, paths, credentials).

### Added in 2.0.1

- **AliExpress** restored as an opt-in service (previously deleted in the fork's 2026-03-25 cleanup). Disabled by default; enable in **Settings → Per-service → AliExpress**. Collects the daily check-in coins via mobile-site emulation and surfaces a per-service row in the Stats tab with its coin history. Needs `AE_EMAIL`/`AE_PASSWORD` only if you want unattended re-login — otherwise click Login on the AliExpress card and cookies persist.

### Added in 2.0.4 — non-root docker, screenshot-on-failure attachments, panel-API healthcheck

Three small-but-asked-for improvements, mostly closing the loop on
self-host ergonomics.

- **Opt-in non-root runtime via `PUID`/`PGID`.** Set them in the env and the
  entrypoint reconciles a runtime user `fgc` with those IDs, chowns
  `/fgc/data`, and drops privileges via `gosu` before TurboVNC and the panel
  start. Files created in your bind-mount or volume end up owned by the
  intended user instead of root. Default behavior unchanged when the vars
  are unset — the entrypoint's root-only block is skipped entirely, no
  surprise migration. Closes upstream
  [#525](https://github.com/vogler/free-games-claimer/issues/525) +
  [#468](https://github.com/vogler/free-games-claimer/issues/468); see
  [Running as a non-root user](#running-as-a-non-root-user) below.

- **Failure notifications now attach the most recent screenshot.** When a
  claim script crashes, `notify()` looks for the newest `.png` under
  `data/screenshots/` written since this run started and passes it to
  apprise via `-a`. Pushover, Discord webhooks, Telegram, etc. render the
  attachment inline. Useful when the failure is visual (captcha, broken
  layout, unexpected modal). Off-switch via `NOTIFY_ATTACH_SCREENSHOTS=0`
  or **Settings → Notifications → Attach screenshot to failures** for
  privacy / bandwidth-conscious deploys.

- **Panel-API healthcheck.** Docker `HEALTHCHECK` now hits
  `http://localhost:7080/api/state` instead of `:6080`. A passing check
  means the panel can actually serve its state, not just that noVNC's HTTP
  listener accepts connections — more diagnostic, same `unless-stopped`
  recovery semantics.

- **GOG catalog watch (notify-only).** In addition to the existing
  homepage spotlight-giveaway claim flow, `gog.js` now queries GOG's
  catalog API for free games not surfaced on the homepage banner — the
  Heartlight-type cases where a paid game becomes free with GOG's
  curated `freegame` tag rather than a discount flag. Baseline-diff
  pattern, same as the Ubisoft watcher: first run after upgrade silently
  records the current free-games list (~60 entries, including long-time
  permafree titles like Witcher 3 REDkit and GWENT), subsequent runs
  notify only on **new** additions to GOG's free-games tag. State lives
  in `data/gog-catalog-watch.json`. Closes feldorn-fork issue
  [#9](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/9) (the GOG
  half).

### Added in 2.0.3 — Steam discovery durability + Ubisoft watcher

Two notable changes plus an Epic Games stability fix.

- **Steam discovery moved off SteamDB.** SteamDB sits behind Cloudflare with Private Access Token enforcement, and the patchright Chromium can't satisfy PAT (it requires real Apple/Google attestation signing keys). SteamDB started returning 403 with no recoverable challenge — a manual solve in noVNC didn't help because the underlying request was rejected before any Turnstile widget rendered. **Discovery now uses Steam's own `search/results/?specials=1&maxprice=free` endpoint** — Steam's own infra, no Cloudflare in the way. Steam's `specials=1` filter naturally excludes free-to-play games (since they have a $0 baseline price and aren't "specials"), so the cleaner filter actually drops the per-app "free to keep vs free weekend vs free to play" parsing pass we used to need. Validated against live Free-to-Keep promotions during the migration.

- **Ubisoft Connect (watch-only, opt-in).** New service that pings you via Apprise when a new free-week promo appears at `store.ubisoft.com/us/free-games`. **No login, no auto-claim** — Ubisoft free-week events fire only every few months and the AAA back-catalog they offer is something most users have already played, so a daily check + manual claim is much better juice/squeeze than building login persistence + captcha handling for a quarterly event. Enable in **Settings → Per-service → Ubisoft Connect**. First run silent (establishes baseline); subsequent runs notify only on new promo-edition titles. State persists in `data/ubisoft-watch.json`.

- **Epic Games "ownership-lag" crash fix.** Epic's storefront shows a placeholder "Get" button while the ownership lookup resolves, then flips to "In Library" 1-2s later if you already own the game. The script was reading the placeholder, clicking it, and timing out 60s waiting for a purchase iframe that never appears (Epic shows an already-owned modal instead) — the uncaught timeout exited the whole script with code 1, skipping any remaining games in the queue. Three layers of defense now: a `networkidle` wait after the initial CTA-text wait, a last-second re-read just before clicking, and a CTA re-probe in the catch block that marks the game as `existed` (not `failed`) when the lag turned out to be the cause.

### Added in 2.0.2 — captcha pause + manual-solve handoff (feedback wanted)

When a runner script hits a captcha that needs a human, the run no longer just fails — it now pauses, pings you, and hands off to noVNC for a manual solve. See [Captcha pause](#captcha-pause) below for the full flow. **This is brand new and currently wired into GOG's login captcha; we want feedback** on the timeout window, the notification copy, and edge cases before we generalize it to AliExpress's slider, hCaptcha, and friends. File issues at [feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues) or comment on a recent captcha-related issue.

Other small panel improvements that landed alongside:

- **Show browser** button on the Sessions tab header (with **Pop out ↗** sibling) — peek at the live noVNC view during a run instead of only during interactive logins.
- **Sessions panel collapse** — click the chevron in the bottom-right of the header (or the status strip itself) to fold the cards down to a one-line row of mini-cards (`name ✓` / `name ✕`). Useful on phones / when watching the browser full-screen.
- **MS Bing-search delay** is now configurable via `MS_SEARCH_DELAY_MAX_SEC` / **Settings → Microsoft Rewards** — drops a typical run from ~90 minutes to whatever you want at your own bot-detection risk.
- **State-aware Sessions placeholder** — the four-step setup tutorial that used to greet every visit (with a misleading "click Check All Sessions" step that's already automatic) is replaced with a context message: "checking sessions (n/N)" during startup auto-check, "N of M sessions need login" if any are red, the existing "Run Now / scheduler" line when all are green.

Bug fixes in 2.0.2:

- **noVNC refresh loop** at `:6080/` — `vnc_auto.html` is a symlink to `vnc.html` in noVNC 1.3.0-2, so the previous Dockerfile `tee` clobbered the real noVNC UI with our self-referential meta-refresh and produced an infinite loop. Closes [#8](https://github.com/feldorn/free-games-claimer/issues/8).
- **MS Rewards activity cards** were timing out for everyone after Microsoft started rendering multiple `#popUpModal` templates (streak-protection, autoredeem warning, etc.) and toggling `ng-hide` to show one. The dismiss helper picked `.first()` and almost always grabbed a hidden one — silent no-op while the visible streak-protection modal blocked every card click. Now scoped to `:not(.ng-hide)`.
- **MS log format** collapsed from three lines per card / search to one. With ~16 cards and ~60 searches per run, drops ~150 lines of churn from each MS run log.
- **"Available services" drawer caret** wasn't actually toggling — JS state was correct but `.drawer-body { display: grid }` beat the UA-default `[hidden] { display: none }` on specificity, so the cards stayed laid out regardless of the hidden attribute.

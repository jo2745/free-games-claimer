# Feldorn's Free Games Claimer

<p align="center">
<img alt="Feldorn's Free Games Claimer" src="assets/logo.png" width="280" />
</p>

A self-hosted scheduler that claims free games and rewards across multiple storefronts on its own. Logs in once via your browser session, then keeps watch — daily checks, captcha-aware pause-and-notify when a human is needed, in-app stats showing what got claimed, what's pending, and how your Microsoft Rewards points are trending.

Discovery isn't limited to each store's own free-game feed — the panel cross-references community aggregators ([gamerpower.com](https://www.gamerpower.com/) and [r/FreeGameFindings](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeGameFindings/)) and picks up launch-day indie promos and storefront-side mystery drops that the first-party feeds miss.

Originally derived from [vogler/free-games-claimer](https://github.com/vogler/free-games-claimer) (dev branch). The control panel, in-app settings UI, claim-history stats, scheduler with hot-reload, AliExpress reintegration, captcha pause + manual-solve handoff, the Steam discovery migration, the Microsoft Rewards collector, the FAB asset claimer, and the Ubisoft / Humble / Fanatical / Lenovo / IndieGala / PSN Plus / Xbox watchers are all additions in this fork. Per-release changes are tracked in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md); [MODIFICATIONS.md](MODIFICATIONS.md) holds a frozen v2.4 snapshot of the diff vs. upstream for historical context.

Services are grouped by what they actually do.

**Claimers** — log in once, then auto-claim any free game that drops:

| <img alt="logo epic-games" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82e9e9bf-b6ac-4f20-91db-36d2c8429cb6" width="24" align="middle" /> [Epic Games Store](https://www.epicgames.com/store/free-games) | Weekly free-game claim |
| <img alt="logo gog" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49040b50-ee14-4439-8e3c-e93cafd7c3a5" width="24" align="middle" /> [GOG](https://www.gog.com) | Homepage giveaways + catalog watch for tag-flagged free items. 2FA-enabled accounts can paste `GOG_OTP_BACKUP_CODES` to auto-consume backup codes on prompt. |
| <img alt="logo steam" src="https://store.steampowered.com/favicon.ico" width="24" align="middle" /> [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com) | Free-to-keep promotions only (not F2P or free weekends). Optional weekly claim of Steam's [Points Shop free item](https://store.steampowered.com/points/shop/c/freeitems) badge/avatar-frame/sticker *(opt-in, off by default)*. |
| 🎨 [FAB](https://www.fab.com/limited-time-free) | Monthly Limited-Time Free 3D assets on Epic's content marketplace. Reuses your Epic Games session via SSO — no second login. *(opt-in, default off)* |

> **Discovery via community aggregators.** Epic and Steam claim eligible games surfaced by [gamerpower.com](https://www.gamerpower.com/) or [r/FreeGameFindings](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeGameFindings/) that don't show up in the storefront's own feed. GOG entries from the same aggregators surface as notify-only items so you can claim them through the panel's noVNC view. See the [Discoveries tab](docs/PANEL.md#discoveries-tab) for the live list with AUTO / NOTIFY / CLAIMED / SKIP / MANUAL badges.

**Point / coin collectors** — daily-cadence reward grinding:

| Service | Notes |
|---|---|
| 🎯 [Microsoft Rewards](https://rewards.bing.com) | Daily Bing searches + activity cards for points, with before/after balance tracking |
| 🛒 [AliExpress](https://m.aliexpress.com) | Daily check-in coins *(opt-in; disabled by default; **deprecated** — see [Bot detection](docs/REFERENCE.md#bot-detection--what-works-what-doesnt))* |
| 🌐 **Custom websites** *(v2.12.5.1+, per-site profiles v2.12.5.2+)* | Visit any user-defined URLs on every run — for sites that award points/coins just for a daily logged-in visit (Temu, Lenovo, …). Each URL you add becomes its own Sessions-tab row with its **own isolated browser profile** (its own cookie jar), so a captcha, block, or stale login on one site can't affect the others. Add URLs in Settings → Services → Custom websites, or via the `CUSTOM_URLS` env var; log in to each site once via its row. *(opt-in; default off)* |

**Watchers** — notify-only; surface new free items so you can grab them yourself:

| Service | Notes |
|---|---|
| 🎮 [Ubisoft Connect](https://store.ubisoft.com/us/free-games) | Pings on new free-week promos *(opt-in)* |
| 📦 [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/store) | Pings on new free items in the Humble store *(opt-in)* |
| 🔑 [Fanatical](https://www.fanatical.com/en/free-games-keys) | Pings on new free Steam-key giveaways *(opt-in)* |
| 🚀 [Lenovo Gaming Key Drops](https://gaming.lenovo.com/game-key-drops) | Tracks scheduled drops + fires push notifications **1h before / 5min before / at drop time** so you can land the queue before keys run out *(opt-in)* |
| 🎲 [IndieGala](https://freebies.indiegala.com/) | Pings on new giveaways on IndieGala's public freebies page — a fast-rotating source of full-game DRM-free + Steam-key promos. Earlier + more precise than the GamerPower aggregator surfaces the same items. *(opt-in)* |
| 🕹 [PlayStation Plus](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/pages/deals) | Notify-only tracker for PSN Plus / free-on-PSN promos — Sony's anti-bot fingerprinting on their storefront makes auto-claim infeasible, so this gives you the "action needed" ping to claim on your console. Backed by the GamerPower aggregator. *(opt-in)* |
| 🎮 [Xbox / Game Pass](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/free-play-days) | Notify-only tracker for Xbox Free Play Days, Game Pass promos, and cross-platform DLC/loot giveaways. Same GamerPower backing as PSN. *(opt-in)* |

> **Why notify-only?** These storefronts have *dynamic* claim flows — newsletter prompts, region acks, "are you sure" modals, and other gates that the sites add and remove without notice — so any scripted claim path is brittle and silently breaks. Some also chain through multiple sites with one-shot vouchers (Lenovo → GamesPlanet → Steam), where a flaky auto-claim wastes the only attempt. Watchers detect *what's available* reliably; the actual grab is left to you, where a human can shrug off a UI change the script can't.

Uses [patchright](https://github.com/nicbarker/patchright) (Chromium with built-in anti-detection). Runs in Docker with a virtual display and VNC access — solve captchas, MFA, and one-time logins through the embedded noVNC viewer in the panel.

## Features at a glance

### 🎮 Collection automation *(what the tool does when you're not looking)*

- **Two-track scheduler with hot-reload** — main claim chain (Prime / Epic / GOG / Steam / FAB) and Microsoft Rewards run on independent schedules so the 30-45 min MS window doesn't block the rest. **Pause/resume toggle** on the Schedule tab suspends scheduled wakes without killing the container — useful during storefront outages, region trips, or fingerprint testing.
- **Captcha pause + noVNC handoff** — when a script can't solve a challenge, it pauses for 10 min, fires a deep-link push notification, and resumes when you solve it via the embedded noVNC viewer.
- **Cookie upload fallback** — for accounts fingerprint-blocked from in-container login: paste a JSON cookie export from your desktop browser and the panel imports the session.
- **Steam-lookup quality filter** *(v2.12.0+)* — opt-in cross-service pre-claim gate. Consults Steam once per game for the user-review score, Metacritic score, and base price, then skips titles below your threshold (default 5/10 score, $2 base price). Applies to any subset of `epic-games / gog / steam / prime-gaming / fab` you list. Results cached 30 days. Solves the "free game with 12 negative reviews still takes a library slot" problem without pulling shovelware you'd never have bought. Default OFF — existing deploys keep claiming everything.
- **Custom websites** *(v2.12.5.1+, per-site profiles v2.12.5.2+)* — visit any user-defined URLs on every scheduled run. For the long tail of sites that award points/coins for simply logging in daily (Temu, Lenovo, …): add the URLs in Settings → Services → Custom websites (one per line) or via `CUSTOM_URLS`, and **each URL gets its own isolated browser profile** — `data/browser-custom-<host>` — so a captcha, block, or stale login on one site can't poison the saved sessions of the others. Every website appears as its own Sessions-tab row (its own Login button, its own session check, its own row in the post-run stale-session alerts), and the runner visits them all — in their saved sessions — on every run.

### 🎛 Control panel & UI *(where you spend your time when you do look)*

- **Always-on panel at `http://localhost:7080`** — log in via embedded noVNC, check session health, trigger Run Now.
- **Web UI authentication** *(v2.11.12+)* — opt-in bcrypt-hashed panel password. Enable via Settings → Web UI Auth (or `PANEL_PASSWORD` env for legacy plaintext). When active, the panel proxies noVNC under its own same-origin `/novnc/*` prefix so **one session cookie gates both** the panel HTTP endpoints and the raw VNC framebuffer WebSocket — no need to publish the `:6080` port separately when exposing fgc through your reverse proxy. 24-hour sliding sessions persist across container restarts; per-IP rate limit on the login endpoint; logout endpoint clears the server-side token. See [`docs/PANEL.md#authentication`](docs/PANEL.md#authentication) for the full setup + reverse-proxy header notes.
- **Sessions tab** — per-service login state, one-click login flows, batch key redemption for Steam / GOG.
- **Settings UI** — every runtime flag `src/config.js` reads is editable in-app, with env-var precedence and revert-to-env for any field.
- **Discoveries aggregator** — live view of [gamerpower.com](https://www.gamerpower.com/) + [r/FreeGameFindings](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeGameFindings/) listings, badged against your auto-claim coverage (AUTO / CLAIMED / NOTIFY / SKIP / MANUAL).

### 📊 Alerts, logs & history *(what happened, what needs attention)*

- **Alerts tab** — single place to see everything that needs your attention: pending code redemptions (Prime + Steam) with Mark redeemed / Dismiss actions, stale-session warnings with one-click re-login, unread items in Discoveries, and one-click *Share to GitHub* for any error caught during a run. Diagnostic submissions carry auto-redacted webhooks/tokens, a config snapshot (scheduler mode, active services, per-service flags, `LANG`, `TZ`), and 25+ lines of surrounding log context — nothing leaves your host without your explicit click. Sections hide when empty, so a healthy run leaves the tab visibly blank.
- **Notifications journal** *(v2.11.0+)* — audit trail of every apprise push fgc has ever fired. Filter by service / kind / status / free-text; expand rows for the full body with clickable URLs. Rolling 500-entry cap, 24h floor so recent items are always visible with "Load more" paging beneath. Answers the "did this actually fire?" question that used to require SSH-ing to `docker logs`.
- **Stats tab** — KPI tiles, per-service tables, 30-day claim chart, recent claims (configurable — default 200, up to 500), Microsoft Rewards balance trend.
- **Run history** — completed runs persisted with full log buffers and summary counters (default 200, configurable up to 500), browsable from the Logs tab.

### 🔔 Integrations & deployment *(how it fits into your stack)*

- **Notifications via [apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise)** — 26+ targets (Pushover, Telegram, Discord, Gotify, ntfy, mailto, Slack, …) with four verbosity tiers: `all` (every event), `actions` (silence uneventful summaries), `digest` (buffer per-run summaries into one daily aggregated notification at your configured hour), `off`.
- **Home Assistant integration** — `/api/hass/sensors` endpoint returns a flat JSON snapshot (MS balance, claim counts, pending redeems, stale sessions, captcha state, last-run status) that HA's stock REST integration consumes with a single config block. Example template sensors, binary sensors, and automations in [`docs/HOMEASSISTANT.md`](docs/HOMEASSISTANT.md).
- **Cron / Sablier ready** — `RUN_ON_STARTUP=2` one-shot mode for scale-to-zero deployments.
- **Reverse-proxy aware** — subdomain, split-subdomain, and subfolder shapes via `BASE_PATH` / `NOVNC_URL`. Multi-arch Docker images (`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`) published to ghcr.io with both semver (`:v2.8.55`) and date (`:20260701`) tags for watchtower / diun-style auto-update workflows.

## Quick Start (Docker)

```sh
docker run --rm -it -p 6080:6080 -p 7080:7080 -v fgc:/fgc/data --pull=always ghcr.io/feldorn/free-games-claimer
```

Open the control panel at **http://localhost:7080**. On first run, click **Login** for each site to log in via the embedded noVNC browser, then either click **Run Now** or set `LOOP` (and optionally `START_TIME`) so the built-in scheduler fires daily on its own. Sessions persist across container restarts in the `fgc` volume.

Full details — Docker Compose, bare-metal Node, non-root mode — in [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md).
